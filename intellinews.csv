Thank you for your courtesy. When I was a member of Congress, I ---- my seat was over there. The seat... The lady with a violent --- not violent but rather violet dress --- seated. But I was always absent together with the Speaker and Tonyboy Floirendo, who is still absent until today. [laughter] And that started… Ay nandiyan ba? Sorry. But his propensity started almost 17 years ago when we were members of the 11th Congress.  Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III and the members of the Senate; Pantaleon Alvarez, the Speaker and the members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; Former Presidents Fidel Ramos, Joseph Estrada, and former President Gloria Arroyo; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno of the Supreme Court and the members of courts; Archbishop Pinto and the distinguished guests of the diplomatic corps; Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; my fellow workers in government; my countrymen.  When I took my oath of office a year or so ago, I knew that our country was reeling from a multitude of problems. That day, there was euphoria in the air resulting from a successful campaign and the thought that dominated my being was to make good on my promise to the people to bring [about change] --- change in government, not a change that is passing but a change that can survive the test of time.  Although I still had to know the magnitude and gravity of the problems, my feeling then was that, equipped with political will and braced by a concerned citizenry, those problems would eventually be bested by us. It was only a matter of determination and collective action. It was only a question of time.  For as I saw it then as I see it now, there is no problem in the world which can stop the march of a people with unflinching and tenacious determination. That was how euphoric --- euphoric it has been.  Early on, I felt that if change was to be meaningful, it had to start with those occupying the highest positions in government because change that comes from below is more transitory than permanent. And I was aiming for permanence. Let change trickle down from [top to] bottom.  It has to be a change that is not confined merely to the replacement of people by people, but a change in the people‘s attitude, disposition and work ethic.  Sadly, although we knew years ago that what was needed or ought to do, we did not do [them] because our idea of government was parochial and we could not rise above family, ethnic andclan loyalties as well as loyalty to friends and co-workers. No one wanted to be a snitch. That is why we are one in saying that genuine change is what this country truly needs.  I believed then, as I believe still, that progress and development will sputter if criminals, illegal drugs, illegal users of drugs are allowed to roam the streets freely, victimizing seeming with impunity, the innocent and the helpless. Worse yet, there were times in the past when the protectors of the people were themselves the perpetrators of the very crimes they were tasked to prevent or suppress. It is ironic as it is madness.  I have learned that economy surges only when there is peace and order prevailing in places where investors can pour [in] their capital and expertise. I have learned from my experience in Davao City that investor confidence [is] bolstered and fortified only if a potent force and mechanism for [the] protection of local and foreign investments are in place.  That is why, I have resolved that no matter how long it takes, the fight against illegal drugs will continue because that is the root cause of so much evil and so much suffering [applause] that weakens the social fabric and deters foreign investments from pouring in. The fight will be unremitting as it will be unrelenting.  Despite international and local pressures, the fight will not stop [applause] until those who deal in it understand that they have to cease, they have to stop because the alternatives are either jail or hell. [applause] And I will make sure, very sure that they will not have the luxury of enjoying the benefits of their greed and madness.  I do not intend to loosen the leash in the campaign or lose the fight against illegal drugs. Neither do I intend to preside over the destruction of the Filipino youth by being timid and tentative in my decisions and actions. [applause]  To the critics against this fight, your efforts will be better spent if you use the influence, moral authority and ascendancy of your organizations over your respective sectors to educate the people on the evils of illegal drugs instead of condemning the authorities and unjustly blaming for every killing that bloodies this country.  But don‘t get me wrong. I value human life the way I value mine. Each life that is snuffed out translates into future generations lost. It is like cracking the acorn from which an oak tree grows - which, in turn, produce the seeds to complete the cycle of [life in] perpetuity.  There is a jungle out there. There are beasts and vultures preying on the helpless, the innocent [and] the unsuspecting. I will not allow the ruin of the youth, the disintegration of families and the retrogression of communities, forced by criminals whose greed for money is as insatiable as it is devoid of moral purpose. Neither will I be immobilized into inaction by the fear that I will commit an act that will expose me to public condemnation or legal prosecution. You harm the children in whose hands the future of this Republic is entrusted, and I will hound you to the very gates of hell. [applause]  That is why I ask you to join me in this fight against illegal drugs and all forms of criminality.  The government, equipped with legal authority, and you, with the moral ascendancy over the sector you represent, can do so much, and hopefully eradicate this social scourge that plagues us no end.Look beyond your biases, your prejudices, your ambition [and] your political agenda. The search for change will begin and end only when we look into ourselves and find it within.  Today, a multitude of problems confront us. No sooner is one problem solved [when] another surges forth in its place. But we will not be disheartened; we will not be cowed; we will not be overwhelmed.  It is during trying times and troubled events that the resilience, perseverance and determination of the people are tested. The Filipino is no stranger or neophyte to situations like the one we face today. We can, and we will, overcome as we did countless times in the past, [but] only if we work together towards a common goal.  Sad to say, despite all efforts, peace, especially in the Island of Mindanao, continues to elude us. But of course, it is not the peace of the dead but the peace of the living that we seek. Peace flits away like a butterfly when you try to snatch it by the wings. And our pursuit of peace continues.  The red insurgency has been with us for decades; the Muslim issue, for centuries.  So much time has lapsed, so many lives have been lost and so much destruction has been wrought but peace eludes us still. Sometimes I am almost tempted to conclude that peace might not be able to come during our lifetime.  But believe me, it will not be for want of trying. And I will persist in our goal of attaining peace [up] to the last day of this administration and maybe even beyond although in a different capacity. [applause]  There is rebellion in Mindanao. The extremists have declared it their purpose to establish a caliphate within Philippine territory along the teachings and beliefs of [the] Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or otherwise known as ISIS. The battle of Marawi has dealt a terrible blow to our quest for peace especially now that an alien ideology and a radical shift in purpose have been injected into the local setting.  I declared Martial Law in Mindanao because I believed that that was the fastest way to quell the rebellion at the least cost of lives and properties. [applause] At the same time, the government would be adequately equipped with the constitutional tool not only to prevent the escape of rebels who can easily mingle and pretend to be civilian evacuees only to re-group in another place to fight another day, but also to prevent them from spreading their gospel of hate and violence in the rest of Mindanao.  Martial Law and the suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus enable the military to arrest, detain and question suspected members and sympathizers of the rebellion similar to what happened to the parents of the Maute brothers.  As president, I am reiterating my unwavering support and commitment to the soldiers of our Armed Forces and the members of our police force --- [applause] those who are on the ground and in the battlefields and those who are risking their lives for our country and our democracy. I have your backs. To those who oppose and think that all these efforts are out of order, I hold myself --- me and me alone should be responsible. [applause]The people of Marawi need help. Caught in the crossfire between government troops and Muslim extremists, they have been through hell and we need to help them rise and move forward.  If we cannot provide for the poor and the needy who are many, then we will not be able to keep from harm the rich who are few.  At the vanguard of our struggle for peace and order are our Armed Forces and Police. They are the silent heroes who risk their lives everyday for our country‘s security. In recognition of their valor, we have crafted a program to provide them with comprehensive social assistance, including financial, should they meet harm in the performance of their duty. For the family left behind by those who fell or are rendered totally disabled in the line of duty, we shall provide shelter, health care assistance, education, and employment. That is my way of telling our troops: never fear, do your duty. I stand behind you. So does this government and all its agencies. [applause]  To decisively address insurgency and terrorism, we are working doubly hard towards [achieving] a stronger and more credible national defense system for the country. We continue to strengthen the defense capability of the AFP as a deterrence against terrorists, lawless elements, and other threats.  My fellow citizens, what I have said so far about the events in Marawi and its neighboring environs is only a part of a looming problem, which will cut across all classes and all sectors of society and eventually affect the entire country from north to south, from east to west, given the fact that Mindanao supplies a great part of our country‘s food requirements. I refer to climate change, which could bring drought and long dry spells affecting food production in Mindanao, given the fact that Mindanao is unusually warming. I ask all agencies involved in food production to look into this and act accordingly.  Also, I am appealing to all our legislators to immediately pass the National Land Use Act or NALUA [applause] to ensure the rational and sustainable use of our land and our physical resources, given the competing needs of food security, housing, businesses and environmental conservation.  Ours is a rich country. Wealth that this country is endowed with [is] a gift from God to be utilized for the [people‘s] welfare and the common good. I do not believe that this gift was given to us to be merely viewed or appreciated, but to be extracted from the earth and utilized to make life worth living.  That is why I say that it is not enough that we mine this wealth. What is more important is that we convert the raw material thereof into finished products for international and local purposes.[applause] That way, it will not only be the few who are the rich but also the poor who are many who will benefit therefrom.  Therefore, I call on our industrialists, investors [and] commercial barons to put up factories and manufacturing establishments right here in the Philippines to process our raw materials into finished products. [applause]  At this point in my administration, if possible, we shall put a stop to the extraction and exportation of our mineral resources to foreign nations [applause] for processing abroad andimporting them back to the Philippines in the form of consumer goods at prices twice or thrice the value of the original raw materials foreign corporations pay for them.  However, in the extraction and utilization of these resources, extreme care must be exercised [applause] that we do not recklessly and needlessly harm the environment. [applause] Responsible, regulated and sustainable development is what we advocate and require. The protection of the environment must be made a priority[applause] ahead of mining and all other activities that adversely affect one way or another. And this policy is non-negotiable.[applause]  I sternly warn… I am warning all mining operations and contractors to refrain from the unbridled and irresponsible destruction of our watersheds, forests, and aquatic resources. You have gained much from mining, we only get about 70 billion a year, but you have considerably neglected your responsibility to protect and preserve --- and even the tax, it‘s about five percent --- environment for posterity.  I am holding all mining companies and its officials responsible for the full and quick clean-up, restoration [and] rehabilitation of all areas damaged by mining activities, and the extension of all necessary support to the communities that have suffered mining‘s disastrous effects on their health, [applause] livelihood, and environment, among others.  Ganito ‗yan eh. Medyo alis muna ako diyan sa… Sasakit ang mata ko diyan sa y*** na ‗yan. [laughter] Alam mo, you have the mining. I have to grant you a mining because you have complied with all the requirements of the law. And I cannot… I‘d be subject to a mandamus if everything is perfect and you have every right to mine. But in doing so, you destroy the rivers, you destroy the streams, from which the poor people fish --- halwan or mudfish --- and that is protein for the day for them.  Ngayon makita mo naman not only Gina Lopez gave you a clear picture of what was happening horrendously. Nakita mo kay Ted Failon --- ‗yung kay Ted Failon, talagang nanood ako, dalawang beses. And I realized that I have to do something about it as a Filipino. [applause]  Alam mo, okay na ‗yung mining. Subsidiary ka lang ng isang another giant corporation or you‘re a sister company of a telecommunication, hindi kayo magugutom. But look at the picture shown to you. For once, they behaved correctly ang ABS-CBN. Tingnan mo ‗yung pelikula ni Ted Failon. I salute him for coming with it. [applause]  You see the palayan… Ang palayan tumuyo at ang soil nag-crack. So the farmers cannot eat anymore. They are reduced to the garbage of what you can get there, salvage anything and sell it to the scrap. Ganun ang nangyari sa Pilipino. Hindi ko kayo kalaban. As a matter of fact, you give government almost 70 billion. Pero actually maliit lang ‗yan.  Ngayon, nakikita ninyo itong mga palayan na tumutuyo and the rivers wala ng isda. The only source of protein. Hindi ka naman pwedeng mag-hunting. May makita kang eagle diyan, barilin mo, preso ka. Pakainin mo ‗yung… Saan mo ipa…?  Try to go out, sumama tayo --- kayo sa akin. And try to see how hard it is for them to survive. Now ito ang… Gusto mo ganito ang pangyayari, tutal sobra-sobra naman ‗yang pera ninyo, adre, sa totoo lang. Mayor ako eh, I can look at your corporate earnings, your sister company, I can pierce the corporate identity, kayo rin pala. And even diyan sa mga newspaper. When you are not supposedto… You know, ‗pag newspaper ka you are supposed to be 100 percentFilipino. And yet when you start to pierce their identity, it is pala fully owned by Americans. Ganun ang nangyari eh. It‘s just a matter of piercing the…  So wala masyado ako… ABS, Rappler kayo ba ‗yan? Have you tried to pierce your identity and it will lead you to America? Do you know that? And yet the constitution requires you to be 100 percent --- media --- Filipino. Rappler, try to pierce the identity and you will end up American ownership. Mayaman na kayo, mga mining companies. Ito ang deal ko sa inyo, either I will raise the taxes, ang kumikita niyan i-reserve ko to compensate for those who are suffering and in agony. [applause]  You have to come up with a substitute, either spend to restore the virginity of their source or I will tax you to death.[applause] Kasi ‗yung taxes makuha ko, talagang ibubuhos ko. Ngayon, if you can make an arrangement, an inventory of the --- ‗yung nasira --- ‗yung mga tao nagutom pati ‗yung river nila wala nang makuha because… You know guys, kayong mga taga-Davao we are not new to it, you want to see horror in your lifetime? Akong bahala. NPA huwag muna kayong magpagara-gara diyan, away-away kay magpunta kami samahan ko sila. You stop your --- puro hambog lang kayo diyan. Punta tayo doon sa Diwalwal, doon sa [inaudible] and I will show you the river. Up there at the source, it‘s so pristine. But doon sa --- right at the start of the boundary where the millings are started, the water there is not clear, it is not brown, it is black. Your one peso will win one million from me if I am lying. Kung gusto mo isama ko kayo bukas doon. Ngayon, ‗pag tinarget tayo ng mga g***** NPA na ‗yan eh problema natin ‗yan lahat. Sabay-sabay na lang tayo. Bakante ang presidency, bakante ang Senado pati ang congressman. Pero totoo ‗yan, you should visit the… Even the first spade, even the first spade full of earth that you extract and throw it away of no use. Itabi mo lang ‗yan diyan eh because it‘s an open pit, you dig and dig and dig, is already the first spade there is the decreasing of Mother Earth.  Alam mo ang isa pang galit sa mining? Si Speaker. He comes from a mining town but he hates mining. Ako naman kasi mga kaibigan ko ‗yung iba, ‗yung mga classmate ko mga vice president ng mining, magpunta sila dito… But it reduces into something --- the damage that you have caused. It‘s not about our friendship. It‘s not about years of being in the same room. It‘s not about being fraternity brothers. But it is something that… [raises his right hand] Ganun ‗yan eh.  Alam mo ‗yung martial law, I am not so much endeavored diyan sabihin ninyo na hindi ninyo ibigay? Okay lang. Wala akong problema diyan. Maski sabihin ninyo na tama na? Okay lang. Then I will still fight. The way I will fight the war. If it is not acceptable to the normal of civilian conduct, then I am sorry because I am not fighting a civilian war, I am stopping violence and rebellion.[applause] Hindi talaga ako…  Ibigay man ninyo o hindi, para sa akin wala. Because ako, I do not intend to go beyond my term. As a matter of fact, mas gusto kong barilin ako doon sa likod. Eh hindi masyado ako itong bilib itong trabahong ito? Akala ko bilib ako. Pagdating ko ah l****, sakit ng ulo. [applause]  Totoo. Kayo nakikinig kayo. Wala akong pinirmahan ni isa, p**** i**** ‗yan na para pagkain. Pagkain-pagkain sa opisina, eh bayaran ninyo ‗yan. Maglabas ako. I do not collect anything. I do not remember. I do not sign anything there until now. Wala akong allowance wala akong tinatanggap lahat except my salary. Tapos dalawang pamilya pa ang maghati. Anong masama niyan? [applause and cheers] Sige kayo pakpak diyan. Lahat naman tayo. [laughter] I can count my… Not even the two hands, one hand lang na exempted sa rule na ‗yan. Dalawa, tatlo, apat, lima. Lokohin ninyo ako, ba‘t tayo pa ba ang maglokohan? Just because this is Congress it hasto be a secret, secret. Maniwala kayong mga ito? Pareho kaming lahat niyan. Ayaw pa tumawa kunwari. [laughter and applause]  So I will increase the taxes. Then I will think of something that will compensate or make up for the damage or at least the income restored. Otherwise, I‘ll have to stop mining. I will ask you to stop it. It‘s not good. We are a small group of islands, hindi naman marami. The coastal, marami ‗yan kasi marami paikot-ikot, but we are in a contiguous territory, maliit lang tayo.  You must remember that there are so many billions of the future generations waiting in this stratosphere. Ang gusto ninyo para hindi na kayo mandamay, huminto na kayo ng ano. Then let us go to… Because this will not end here. How about the billions and billions and billions of Filipinos who will come after us? Kawawa naman. They‘ll have to scratch Mother Earth to eat. By this time kung walang upheaval, no regeneration will occur, we are almost like talagang ginaganun natin ang --- maliit na lang ang makuha nila. But maawa naman kayo. Makikita mo ‗yung apo mo kung ganun mo na lang… Kung ganun mo na lang ‗yung --- embrace mo ‗yung apo mo sa pangalawang asawa. ‗Yung isa ganun rin. ‗Di ba? ‗Di ba, sir?[laughter] Suntukin kita diyan ngayon, liar ka.  Finally, let me make this appeal to those directly engaged in mining. Declare your correct income [and] pay your correct taxes. Believe me, your failure to do so will be your undoing and eventual ruin. [applause]  Hindi na ako makatakbo, matanda na ako. I don‘t think I‘ll even survive the five years. Pero pagka sinabi ko upakan kita, upakan talaga kita.  To our employees and officials of the LGUs tasked with monitoring these mining operations within their territorial jurisdictions, do your job without fear or favor. I [hold] you absolutely responsible for any misdeed or failure [by] the mining entities to comply --- do not comply or comply with the guidelines, rules and regulations governing mining operations and activities within your area of responsibility. I mean it. Do not try to test my resolve. Absolutely I have nothing to lose except my life.  While we can control the acts of man, no one can control [or] stop the fury and rampage of weather gone wild. When nature fights back, it does so with a vengeance.  We have seen the terrible toll that Super typhoon Yolanda and the succeeding typhoons exacted in terms of human life and property. And we still have to recover from the beating that we got both during and in the aftermath of those mega-typhoons.  Aside from droughts, tempests and other problems taking shape which, according to DOST- PHIVOLCS --- it is no longer just a distant possibility but a probability: Earthquakes.  The series of damaging quakes in Leyte, Surigao and nearby provinces and islands attest to this. We were told that it is no longer a question of ―ifǁ but a matter of ―when.ǁ  Thus, we need to act decisively and fast because the threat is huge, real and imminent.  Come to think of it really, they say that there is no perfect instrument or human acumen can really predict earthquake. I hope it will not come. Kasi kung magdating ‗yung sabi nila ‗yung ―Big Oneǁ, Ihope it will be just in the mountains and in the rural areas. Because if it‘s right --- sabihinnila tinatakot nila ang… Media kasi… Nandito eh in the speech, I reviewed it last night. I am calling [on] both houses of Congress to expeditiously craft a law establishing a new authority or department that is responsive to the prevailing 21st century conditions and empowered to best deliver [an] enhanced disaster resiliency and quick disaster response.  While the law is [being] crafted with extreme urgency, we need to undertake immediate action to ensure disaster resiliency and effective response in the greater [Metro] Manila area, which is our country‘s seat of governance, center of business, commerce, and the academe. Disaster resiliency of Metro Manila and the surrounding provinces is a matter of urgent [national ] concern.  Iyon nandito ‗yan, tinatakot nila dito because of the high-rise buildings and… Ilang tao ang nakatira diyan? Kung… Kaya kaya ito sa isang sinkhole? I mean if it cracks and it goes down, can we still manage to go up? God, huwag ngayon ha kay nandito ako. Hintayin mo lang ‗yan sila na lang sila dito nag-aaway. [laughter]  I am directing the Cabinet Cluster on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management to immediately work hand in hand with the concerned LGUs, the private sector and the affected communities themselves, in undertaking disaster [resiliency] measures, antidotes.  We all need to act fast.  With all the foregoing said, what then is the state of the nation today?  I will mince no words and neither will I window-dress the situation [that] we are in. Let me answer in two brief sentences. We are in --- for trouble --- because we live in troubled and uncertain times. And I fear that things might get worse before they become better. But like I said I hope we will cope, we hope and pray.  The West Philippine Sea issue and Federalism are matters that we have to tackle sooner or later.  On the other hand, despite our recent gains in improving the peace and order situation in the country, there is still so much to be desired and if we are to completely eradicate the menace of illegal drugs, criminality and corruption, we must do it.  I therefore ask Congress to act on all pending legislations to reimpose the death penalty on heinous crimes — especially on the trafficking of illegal drugs.  There is a shortage… No, no, no. There is a short clip of CNN about people in Massachusetts, was it there? Iyong clip nila ang ipinakita. Tiningnan… Pakitingin lang… It‘s repeated for almost every week yata ‗yang mga short clips. Tingnan mo ‗yung mga tao doon na hinayaan nilang mag… They are there, they live under the bridge, they are getting thin, they are doing nothing. Nakaganun lang sila tapos po-pose ng ano… And they are aplenty there. They do not work, wala.  Tapos sabi ng UN… Is he here? Are you there iyong UN representative? Na sinabi mo na shabu will not affect the brain? Are you here? Raise your right hand, if you‘re here. Do not worry. I will just… Do not --- the word ―deludeǁ as into you… Iyong mga ano ninyo na --- but weknow everyday that one family raped, dalawa and all are dead. Then you trivialize it with human rights and due process. Okay ako niyan. When you go into an anger, when you burst with rage, okay ‗yan. But with so many killings as brutal and as cruel as what happened, if you add human rights and due process, you stink and your mouth smells. If you want to criticize, criticize, condemn the act, stop there. But do not give the excuse or do not make it trivial by saying human rights at least we‘ll be protected... Iyan ang pinakab***** na magawa ng isang tao. When you criticize, stick on one topic. Then you find an event where you can talk about human rights and due process, but do not talk about it in the same time when there is a carnage and you begin to blabber, talk about human rights. Lalong nagagalit ang tao. Eh p****** i** mo. May namatay na diyan, akala mo kung sino ka. [applause] What have you done in the name of human rights? Seventy-seven --- you have the records. You can summon the police. Seventy- seven before I became president. All drug- related, 77,000. And you trivialize that with a conference… At tsaka pumunta dito ang tatanungin ‗yung nasa presuhan na pinireso dahil nag - -- just imagine…  I challenge you, you want a debate in public? Okay, we‘ll have it. I will challenge you how also you trivialize the thing by --- ‗yung binibigyan niyo ng importansiya si De Lima. You all know, you were all here. You conducted the investigation. You heard the witnesses. You saw the videos. Is she a credible woman? Can she be a moral person? [applause] Puro kayo drama diyan sa…  When you talk about an incident, talk about it, then condemn, condemn the police. But do not connect it with due process and human rights. Mag-mukha kang g*** sa harap ng Pilipino. You know why I get this rating? I could not be brighter than you and my work is not more important or your vocation is not less than mine. But when you talk in public carry the proper message. Kaya mag-82 kayo or kaya binobombahan niyo kasi ako ng ganun. Sasabihin naman ng mga tao, ―Eh tama ‗yan. Tama ‗yan si Duterte.ǁ Kasi nangyayari eh. Eh kayo man ang front sa pa- ganun-ganun, eh ‗pag may namatay diyan na maraming massacre, ni-rape mga babae, bata, hindi kayo umiimik. [applause] Maya-maya pagdating ng mga --- [applause and cheers] pagdating nitong mga Western expert kuno, you give them so much premium and importance. Saan ba ang utak ninyo? Bakit kayo bilib diyan sa puti? Tingnan mo ang puti, panahon ni Obama, una ‗yung spokesman ng State Department. Akala mo kung sino. Akala nila mas bright pa sila sa akin. Then the staff of the President, then Obama. ―I would like to remind Mr. Duterte that the policy of…ǁ Eh ‗di yari ako. Pagdating ni Trump, ―Oh yes, Mr. President, I‘ve been expecting your call. You are doing it all right… And this G*******…ǁ [applause] Uwi na ako. T**** i*** ‗yan.  So? That‘s the value of the country that you value. Ambivalent. Parang electric fan. Okay dito o hindi na okay, it‘s vacillating. Tapos kayong mga --- bilib kayo. Hindi ko talaga maintindihan ang Pilipino. It takes for an American to say that I‘m a son of a b****. And it takes for an American to say, ―Oh you‘re great. You‘re a hero in your country.ǁ O saan ako pumunta dito ngayon? [laughter]  It is time for us to fulfill our mandate to protect our people from these crimes that have victimized… You know, huwag ninyo akong takot-takutin niyang preso ‗yung international court of justice. S***, I am willing to go to prison for the rest of my life. Ang importante sa akin ginagaw ko ‗yung gusto ko. [applause]  Alam mo kasi in this country it is a rule of majority. I did it for the 50 plus one because in a vote of 100, I get 51, 50 plus one. Fifty is one-half, one, that is majority of one, I win. ‗Yung 49, ‗yon ‗yung mga… I do not have to make them happy. But when the time comes, eh kung malasinako, pupunta ako sa presuhan, do not worry about me. I can take it. Noong maliit pa ako, labas- pasok ako sa… Wala pa ‗yang law ni Pangilinan. Labas-pasok na ako sa presuhan. Kunin ninyo ‗yung record sa pulis doon sa Davao. Takutin na, ―He will be prosecuted.ǁ Hoy, abogado ako because I will…  Sabi ko nga, everybody is entitled to come here and question me, but I have to question you also. At para magaling, let us make it official. We go to court and we tell the judge that we are hearing by an international body, can we have it judicially recorded? And I will place them under oath. Mahuli ko man talaga ‗yan sila. May pinatay ako, tama ‗yan. When I was mayor, a little over… For 23 years ako mayor ng Davao eh. Makita mo ang Davao ngayon, you have been LGUs before. What city is now hitting nine growth percent? Eh nandoon pa kami sa Mindanao, binobomba pa kami sa Davao. Davao is nine growth. Tapos sabihin ninyo… Ngayon, paano ngayon i-nine mo ‗yung --- palabas mo itong nine we are about to hit six or so, sabi nila. Pero ‗pag hayaan mo lang ako, mag-abot ito ng 21, the highest in the world. [applause] Kayo lang ang taga-pigil eh.  It is time for us to fulfill our mandate to protect… Tapos na ‗yan. Kindly… For so long… We have to act decisively on this contentious issue.  Capital punishment is not only about deterrence. It is also about retribution. Make no mistake about that.  Iba kasi ako eh. Let us understand each other including the international community. Ang aming --- our criminal system uses the Revised Penal Code. That is a law that was given to us by the Spaniards, the original Revised Penal Code. Though it was translated into English and in this two books, three books, there are the definition of crimes and the penalties and everything. And the thrust of that Revised Penal Code, ladies and gentlemen, is the essence of retribution. That is why you have penalties. There is also the word ―positivist theoryǁ that you can nurture a criminal into goodness provided he goes to prison for two years, three years, he‘s released, he‘s a sex offender. When he goes out, he rapes again, kidnaps another girl and makes her a hostage for so many years. Ganun kayo eh. Admit it, ganun kayo. You are so too lenient about this son of a b****, a human being that has a virulent brain and his enemy is society.  And many at times, there were sex offenders in America released only to rape and kidnap again and kill in just a few months after release. In the Philippines, it is really an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. You took a life then you must pay for life. That is the only way to even. You cannot place a premium on the human mind that he will go straight. Nobody can. Not even your best scientist. No one has ever fathomed how a person would react especially in committing crimes. That‘s the only way to do it to instill fear, that if you do it, you will die. That‘s the advantage of criminals and rebels and terrorists because they think that you are afraid to die.  That‘s why when I went to Marawi, I was asked by the media, ―Why are you here?ǁ ―I am here because my soldiers are here and I came here to die also.ǁ [applause] Because any battle, any fierce encounter, you have to be of equal equanimity. Gusto siyang mamatay, eh ‗di gusto ko ring mamatay.  They say that they use the name of God, and the Christians say, ―we have the same thing.ǁ I read the Ecclesiastes 3. What does it say? Even during elections, there is a time to be great and a time for defeat. A time to be in the skies, emblazoned there and a time to be [inaudible] somebody. A time to have money, a time to be hard up. A time to just walk so many kilometersto school and a time for graduation and being a lawyer. A time to be… I don‘t know what I am now. There‗s always a time. [laughter and applause]  Ganun ‗yan eh. So I‘ll match you. ‗Pag sinabi mong, ―Gusto kong mamatay.ǁ Anak ka ng… Dalawa tayo. This bully, you know I had dinner with them sa Bayan. Itong NDF because I used to be friends really with the NDF. I was crossing the ideological borders before. Ako ‗yung nakakapasok sa teritoryo and we were friends really. But times have changed because God placed me here and I take care of a Republic. Sabi nila doon ―bullyǁ daw ako. T******* pala kayo, talagang bully ako. [laughter and applause] P***** i**. Talagang bully ako especially to the enemies of the state, talagang bully ako. [applause]  Ito pa, sabi ko sa mga sundalo, ‗yung mga human rights na ano, you are flying everywhere, anywhere ‗yung mga utak ninyo. I said, ―Take no prisoners.ǁ Which is [garbled] --- ―kill themǁ. Which is correct? But you don‘t listen to my speech. This media --- lalo na itong ABS --- kunin lang ‗yang, ―kill them.ǁ [laughter]  ‗Yan ang problema ninyo kaya minura ko kayo. Walang Presidente na p*******i** kayo because you are not behaving. Now you‘re asking me for talks… [applause and cheers] When you publish in the newspaper or quote us in media, itong mga reporters would only quote ―kill them.ǁ  I said, ―Kill them in a fight. If you have to shoot them, shoot them at the heart or the head.ǁ Sabi ko. Why? Because they will be detained here in Marawi, wala tayong presuhan. [laughter] ngayon, and the courts will always insist that they will be --- that‘s the law --- that they will be tried and detained in the place where they committed the crime. Kaya huwag kayong mag --- patayin talaga ninyo, kasi ilagay natin ‗yan diyan sa barracks natin diyan, sa ating Mechanized Division. Pag-eskapo niyan, dalhin ‗yung kanyon natin, ipaputok pa sa atin. [laughter] Marami. How many jail --- [anong tawag dito?] --- jailbreaks in Mindanao, in Cotabato alone? Six. Cotabato City, four. Ang jail doon, nire-raid tapos pinapalabas.  Alam ba ninyo ‗yan? Because you do not publish. Or itong mga taga-Maynila… Hindi kayo, mga bright kayo, bilib ako. Mga g****g****. Sabi na ―Why do you…?ǁ Why? What happened last April in Davao? It was bombed. How many were killed? Twenty-seven. Few years ago, the church was bombed twice. How many died? Fifty-nine. The airport just as the people were coming out of the departure --- ah arrival --- it was bombed. How many died? Thirty-two. In the war, three nuns were lining up there. I had to scoop the brain of the nun to put it in a can because the face was shattered. Zamboanga. And you say that the violation is only in Marawi? Torpe. Talaga kayong… Mag-usap tayo ngayon. Dalhin ko kayo doon sa mga biyuda. Kailan lang ‗yun?  Huwag niyong sabihin na ―It‘s only in Marawi.ǁ Rebellion has been going on in Mindanao. Walang sinasanto doon. Hindi lang ninyo binabasa nang husto. What‘s the… It‘s very porous. Kung separate islands ‗yan, maybe. Kung separate ‗yan --- very porous, they can go… And Mindanao --- this is not to… The Moro has nothing to do with it, pareho tayo. Pareho tayong Maranao, so just shut up. Huwag kayong ma… Ito ang totoo.  Maraming Muslim sa Mindanao. Lahat… Eh sa Abra, meron eh. In this fight… Well, where do you think the Moro would side? Kung patayan na. They will side with government? Kung ako ngayon, kung nakatira ako, hindi kami umalis ng --- hindi ako dinala ng nanay ko sa labas. I‘ll be a resident of Marawi, what do you think will be my sentiment? Sulu. Davao, puro Muslim enclaves ‗yan, there are enclaves, parang baryo-baryo. Kapag sentimiyento ang putukan, magputok ‗yan sabay-sabay.On another thing, I‘ll talk it about in the conference. Sumobra itong Left eh. Maggawa ka ng bahay --- nakawin. Ang sabi ko sa sundalo, ―Do not force the issue. I will just build yours. Ibigay mo na lang.ǁ  May project ngayon, gusto na naman nilang kuhanin. Do not commit that mistake. Here and now, I will tell you, including the Congress of the Republic of the Philippines: You do anarchy, I will order the soldiers and the police to shoot. Even if I have to bury thousand of Filipinos. Huwag ninyo akong ganunin.  Either you‘re… Either… Let us understand this beginning today, either we have laws in this country or we do not. We enforce the laws against the miners and the rich, but I will also enforce laws against anarchy, disturbance, and create trouble. Kayo rin, natatakot din eh. [applause]  Takutin ninyo ako na occupy the streets? Anak ng jueteng. You stay there, you ask for two days, I will give you six months. Huwag kayong umalis diyan. Kainin ninyo pati ‗yung dumi ninyo diyan.  Takut-takutin mo ang gobyerno. I‘m sorry I‘ve exceeded my time, but… Eh kailangan kong sabihin eh. Para maintindihan din nila. Tutal nandito na lang rin ako sa media. Nakikinig pati lahat. Kayong mga Left, I will not talk to you. Why should I? [applause] Huwag mo na akong pilitin na magpatayo kayo mga pro-poor, shut up. Wait for two years, because I have…  You know, this is my proposal. I may be totally wrong and I will accept it, but this is mine. From now on, I will save money for the Armed Forces of the Philippines. We have lost so much soldiers.[applause] And there are thousands already incapacitated to fight. Pati ‗yung police ko, araw-araw ninyong ina-ambush. Pati ang convoy ko, kasi doon ako mag-sakay, in-aambush nila.  Pati akong --- g***. P*****i**, pati ako, patayin nila. Sabagay, malayo ako doon. Pero convoy ko kasi ‗yun eh. Waiting lang ako doon sa ano… Alam mo ginamitan niyo ng machine gun. Kaya lang armorized.  Kayong mga congressman, senador na ayaw ninyong --- baka may kalaban kayo. Asawa ba ninyo ‗yung katira ninyo ngayon?[laughter] O inagaw ninyo? Pa-armorize ninyo. Totoo. Proven, M60.[applause] Si… Si Senator Drilon, M60, sir. Hindi talaga ‗to maalis. Kasi binara na nila. Nasira na lang ‗yung --- ‗di talaga nila. And the soldiers inside were all there all the time, mina- machine gun na, hindi tatalab.  Mga g***, pati ‗yung convoy ko, ambushin. Hindi nila alam na nakasibat na ako. [applause] Kaya gusto niyo kong mag-usap tayo, no, sumobra kayo. Ikaw, Sison, tang … Mag-inom ka ng Tang ‗yung orange. [laughter] Matanda ka na. Kayong Pilipinas, makinig, buong Pilipinas. Kayong mga bata, kayong mga Lumad natives, itong matatanda na ito, Sison is sick. May colon cancer. Ang gastos ng Norway, sumurender na siya. Kasi naging isyu sa pulitika eh. This government who sponsored those --- who provided the good offices. Matatalo sa eleksyon dahil sa issue diyan. Kasi pabalik-balik ang mga b****, kala mo mga turista. Wala namang pinag-uusapan.  Pagdating dito, gusto ng ganito, gusto ng ganyan, ah l*** mo.[laughter] Huwag mong sabihin ‗yung meaning doon sa mga bisita. Napura na ako ba. Talagang ano ako, sir. Masyadong demanding, ni hindi naman kayo nanalo ng elections ni minsan. You cannot even hang on into abarangay. And you keep on killing people, hindi lang ‗yung mga pulis, pati ‗yung mga civilians na ayaw magsali sa kanila.  Kaya sabi ko ano --- sabi ko talaga, ―buang ka.ǁ And sinabi ko talaga. Pardon pa si…. Pi****** i** ko talaga siya the other day sa Davao. Sinong tinatakot ninyo? Katanda-tanda na ninyo eh. At lahat tayo mamatay. Kayong mga naiwan diyan sa kalsada, mabuti pa umuwi kayo. Wala kayong makuha diyan sa komunista.[applause]  Do you think that if the ISIS prevails in this country that you will have a place in their society? You must be awfully stupid, as stupid. [applause] Wala kayong makuha. Lahat tayo damay. Thank you for allowing the exhaust dito.  In our sustained effort to achieve just and lasting peace[laughter and applause]… Class, be courteous. Do not make a noise. The visitors are listening. [laughter] Just and lasting peace for a [unified] nation, we are pursuing an inclusive peace process, promoting the participation of all stakeholders, including those conflict-affected areas.  We took steps to promote inclusiveness in the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) by expanding its membership through Executive Order Number 8 which I signed in November last year.  By giving representation to indigenous peoples, women, children, and sultanates, and key stakeholders in the drafting of the Bangsa[moro] Basic Law, we ensure a Bangsamoro government that truly reflects the aspirations of our Muslim brothers and sisters as well as our indigenous brethren. [applause]  We have embarked on various initiatives to advance our national interest in the global community. We pursue good relations with all nations anchored on an independent --- on an independent foreign policy [applause] --- and the basic tenets of sovereign equality, mutual respect and non-interference. [applause]  As an independent nation, we will uphold and promote our national interests in the international community. We will strengthen and seek partnership with those who share our values. We will engage nations with full respect for the rule of law, sovereign equality, and again, non- interference. These are the principles that we are upholding as we advance to this year for the meeting as the Chair of the ASEAN.  We have cultivated warmer relations with China through bilateral dialogues and other mechanisms, leading to easing of tensions between the two countries and improved negotiating environment on the West Philippine Sea.  At this point, allow me to take a step back in time, in 1901. In 1901, there was known as Balangiga, and that is Eastern Samar. It was the time for Philippine-American War.  A combined group of Filipino villagers and guerrillas, in an effort to defend Samar Island from the alien invaders, attacked and overwhelmed a U.S. --- a United States infantry garrison. Forty- eight American officers and men were slain in the attack. On the Filipino side, the casualty count was twenty-eight killed and twenty-two wounded.In retaliation, U.S. gunboats and patrols were sent to Balangiga, Samar with the order to ―…make a desert of Balangigaǁ and to reduce Samar Island into an island of ―howling wilderness,ǁ where every male citizen from the age of ten and above, and capable of bearing arms, would be put to death. The Church bells of Balangiga were seized by the Americans as spoils of war.  Those bells are reminders of the gallantry and heroism of our forebears who resisted the American colonizers and sacrificed their lives in the process. Krag against bolo --- krag was the standard rifle issued to the American troops. And that is how the historians describe.  [Nauna ka, pababa mo. Hindi, baba mo, tumataas ‗yan.][laughter] Mahirap talag kung director ka, ikaw pa ang speech.[laughter] Many historians describe --- [sige] the Philippine-American war. That is why I say today; give us back those Balangiga bells. [applause] They are ours. They belong to the Philippines. [applause] They are part of our national heritage. [applause] Isauli naman ninyo. Masakit ‗yun sa amin.  We now talk about our Overseas Filipinos. They are our heroes. They and their families have sacrificed much to the --- for the country. We all know how a large part of our economic --- economy comes from their remittances. That is why to ensure that their rights are protected, I ordered the increase of our assistance to the OFW from 400 million pesos to more than 1 billion. [applause]  We have been hard at work in securing the rights and welfare of our OFWs.  A year ago, I also warned government officials and employees that I will never tolerate corruption in my administration, not even a whiff of it. Let the dismissal of several high-ranking officials --- whom I myself appointed --- serve as a warning to all that I will never back down on my commitment to cleanse this government and corporation. [applause]  In order to bring government services closer to the people, we established hotlines [and] government centers that receive public concerns, one of which is the Hotline 911, which allowed us to receive and immediately respond to emergencies.  We also launched Hot --- launched Hotline 8888, the Citizen‘s Complaint Hotline. This is a public hotline facility that receives feedbacks or concerns on government services.  Since we launched this hotline, we have received numerous complaints from the public on government --- slow government processing, unclear or changing procedures and requirements, centralized issuances of clearances and permits in Metro Manila and discourteous government employees, among others.  Ganito ‗yan. Time and again, ‗yung --- ‗yung pag-transact ng ordinaryo --- no, the ordinary people who contract business in government. In the last ASEAN Ministerial Conference, I don‘t know why Malacañang has to --- my office has to do some work for --- or the others, like itong mga barong. It‘s always the --- that outfit takes care of the attires that will be given to the ministerials, this time, to the heads of state.  Alam mo, I‘d like to address this myself to government. Iyan bang bayaran, pabalik-balikin ninyo ang tao. Alam… I know that because I‘ve been mayor for 23 years, I never allowed it in my city.But dito, alam mo ‗yang mga sastre diyan sa Parañaque hanggang Cavite --- ‗yung mga tailoring diyan --- ang negosyo lang niyan involve boy scout, teachers‘ uniform, girl scouts, naghahabol ‗yan sila ng mga kontrata.  And they are just the --- the stores that you find along the way until Cavite. They group together during times of ganito, may ASEAN. And they look for a person to represent them.  This is not --- no offense intended but --- usually, they look for beautiful women, young, who would do the talking, arrangement. You know, because it‘s the… Well, it‘s the reality of life, that the beautiful women get the attention always.  Tapos, ‗pag na-deliver na nila, nasukatan na, pabalik-balikin ninyo. And right there in Malacañan, it happened. So, I will fire the lady, whoever was connected with her, as I have fired everybody else. A Cabinet member for buying an 18-million truck in Austria. That was not our contract. It was a contract of the previous administration. Fourteen of those 18 million were already delivered.  This Cabinet member was… I was informed about and I said the legal --- his legal office --- to stop it. You know what? He went just right ahead, traveled there, signed something for the --- another tranche of delivery. So right there at the meeting --- right in the Cabinet meeting I said, ―Were you able to read the opinion of your law --- your own law office?ǁ He said, ―No.ǁ But  Sonny Dominguez was already passing to me the --- ‗yung sa iPhone. So I was reading it while I was talking to him. Sabi ko, ―P***** i** mo, you‘re fired. You‘re lying.ǁ And so I fired him, ―Go out of this office. I do not want to see your face again.ǁ Ganon ako ka-istrikto.  So ‗yung --- the Cabinet members --- and they are here --- they‘re only given, noon, one year, two years --- one month. The directors, makinig kayo sa gobyerno, bantay kayo. Directors, you‘re only given 15 days. And I do not want directors out of their office, you eat your lunch there, lahat kayong taga-gobyerno, so that you can resume to work immediately. [applause]  Now, ito ang deal ko sa public. There is the 8888. I cannot stop corruption and wrongdoings if you do not cooperate. You text me. Libre ‗yan --- 8888. You name the public official, name his sins in that bulletin, and I will take it from there. Do not be afraid about libel, I will take care of that. [applause]  Iyon ang gawain ninyo. I have to have your help. Kung hindi kasi kayo mag-ano, wala eh. Lahat. Pulis, military, lahat, pati ako. If you think that some of --- may nagawa ako na masama, sabihin ninyo. Do not be afraid.  We are all workers of government, kayo ‗yung employer namin. [applause] We get the money from your pocket to our pockets. Kami --- kailan pa… Since when have you heard me talk about government and officials? I always address everybody, ―workers of government.ǁ  I seldom mention ―Malacañan Palaceǁ. It is not a palace, it is just a house of wood. So, why should I call it a palace? Maybe something like the European-style. I just call it office. Palace, palace ka diyan eh. [laughter] And besides, all the rats of Pasig are there. [laughter]  It‘s just beside Pasig River. So ‗yung lahat ng mga daga diyan kung saan-saan, doon nagla- landing. It has a wild field, and they are not killed because they are Presidential mouse. [laughter]Iyon ang sabi ng --- iyan o sundalo. ―Sir, ‗di daw ipagbaril kay Presidential mouse.ǁ P***** i**, mabuti pa ang mouse dito kay hindi pa pinapatay, ‗yung tao kinakatay ninyo.  The people‘s patience is wearing thin, so is mine.  I am reiterating my directive to all government agencies [with] frontline services to our people -- from womb to tomb -- to further streamline their respective services to make these truly efficient and people-friendly.  We want to ensure that our people receive the quality services that they surely deserve minus the delays by the bureaucratic red tape. I expect speedy reforms along this line.  We‘ll rightsize the national government. Let us trim the excess fat and add more muscle through the expeditious passage of ―The Act Rightsizing the National Government to Improve Public Service Institute.ǁ [applause]  I therefore urge Congress to pass this at the soonest.  For the Government Owned and Controlled Corporations --- isa pa kayo --- the implementation of the existing Salary Standardization Law pending review in the Compensation and Position Classification System. Excessive, extravagant, and unconscionable salaries and allowances, incentives, benefits and bonuses across the Government Owned or Controlled Corporations at this time, in crisis.  You‘ll have to pass by my office and I am not inclined to increase your allowances, bonuses, and salaries at this time. Wala ‗yan. [applause]  You cannot do it on your own. You have to direct it to the Executive Secretary. And I‘ll just tell you, I am not inclined to give increases right now. Maybe seven years from now, when Drilon makes it to the presidency.  I also appeal to the Supreme Court to seriously consider the national interest and our development goals before issuing TROs and injunctions on critical government projects and cases involving government assets.  I am just a co-worker also, ladies and gentlemen. May I be allowed to be also just as frank? Tutal wala naman akong ina-ano, eh. I do not need to offend you.  But I cite, for example, the Supreme Court TRO that prevents the Department of Health from distributing subdermal implants, which caused a wastage of P350-million worth of taxpayers‘ money. I also note that since its issuance two years ago, this TRO has impaired the government‘s ability to fully implement responsible planning --- family planning methods in the RH Law.  It is time that we put an end to the practice of some parties of resorting to technicalities in our laws to prevent the government from fulfilling its mandate.  Ganito ‗yan, ma‘am, eh. Tutal, this is as good as any other time to talk to you. And may I be understood by you --- I am sorry to say this, really, I am --- I do not intend to do it. But if we haveto talk about government and our sins, which I am not an exception, all our --- you know --- delays, lahat naman tayo nagkakamali.  Ganito ‗yan, two things. Wala na talaga akong panahon. I‘ll just stay… I don‘t know if I can make another SONA again in the future. It‘s --- it‘s not for me to tell.  Itong TRO has been the bane of projects. And even Consunji, ‗yang mga Ayala, nag-aaway ‗yan. Just to make you understand na hindi lang kayo. Tapos, ‗yang TRO na ‗yan would delay the projects. Now God --- and I‘m asking Congress, find me a law na kung may bidding naman at it was regular, dapat ang korte or somebody else should not be messing it up.  Because it can delay the projects, which has been the case in the provinces. Alam mo, mag-file ‗yan ng kaso --- either it is really the truth and the COA will find out or makihati siya --- ―I will withdraw the case and dissolve the TRO of course. But just give me a few --- 10 percent.ǁ  Ganun ang ugali ng Pilipino. Kaya ‗yang TRO na ‗yan is the bane of our efficiency, and I really do not know whether… I will not attribute anything, ma‘am, sa Supreme Court.  Maybe I am at fault so I am sorry if I misquote or I did not have the complete facts. But itong Congress na ito passed the Reproduction Law. It was already a law na dapat i-implement because we are really going into a family planning. I am not for abortion. I am not for birth control. But certainly, I am for the giving of the freedom to a Filipino family the size ng pamilya niya. [applause]  How many children would he be able to support and send to school? Ang nangyari nitong TRO , sir, ma‘am, may nag-file doon sa inyo --- Supreme Court --- tapos nag-issue kayo ng TRO two years ago. In the meantime, ‗yung --- ang gobyerno, nagbili ng medisina --- ito subdermal pati itong mga pills worth 360. It was not really a reckless purchase. It was in preparation for the implementation of the law.  Hindi naman akalain na mag-TRO and it has been two years. The medicines will expire next month. I told Ubial, the Health Secretary, to find out if there is a nation who --- which would allow it and i-donate na lang rather than go to waste.  Iyan ho ang nangyari. I do not blame you. You might have been very busy or something. Wala. Ako, I ‗m just… I am below you, actually. Pero sinasabi ko lang. May isa pa.  Huwag na lang itong speech, walang kwenta, walang makukuha diyan. [laughter] The bane --- isa pa itong --- the Congress and tayo sa gobyerno, including the judges and justices, should understand that by this time, ‗yung lowest bid, ‗yun ang nagpo-promote ng graft and corruption sa ating bayan. [applause]  COA, you are here. Malaman na lang ninyo na may violation ako. Doon sa military, I do not allow them to bid and just to buy the weapons from everywhere, because almost all countries are making arms. Tawag nila, small arms industry. We‘re just fighting a rebellion. True, we do not need the armaments.  But diyan sa Marawi, you have to hit hard because they are prepositioned inside buildings. And until now, we cannot proceed fast because there are 300 hostages. Sabi ko, ―Do not assault. If necessary, we‘ll just have to wait. Wait it out.ǁBut we have to give food. You do not --- I do not care if they are Moro or Christians. It‘s not… We do not have that luxury. Kasi ‗pag --- there is a distinct possibility that we attack, they will just behead everybody.  So, find a way to do it. If you cannot find a way to do it then just I said, ―Wait it out.ǁ Sila ang nakatagal. Baka sabihin hindi marunong itong sundalo. Ako ‗yung pipigil. Initially, sabi ko bomba. ―Eh, sir, hindi talaga madala, sir.ǁ Every window is occupied, ‗yung high-rise. And we were losing because of the snipers. And in there, they hurry, I said, ―Slow down.ǁ  When I was --- hindi ako nagyayabang --- when I was in the camp sa Ranao, while I was briefing --- I was being briefed by the military and was giving the instructions, I heard about 16 pumutok at tsaka ‗yung bala na, ―Weng, weng, weng!ǁ Iyong mga reporter nandoon sa likod ng stage kasi semento ‗yun eh. We will ano… Sabi ko, ―If this is how we should wait, then we‘ll wait. Unless you can find a solution --- somebody here who has a good, even a horse sense to negotiate for the release of…ǁ  Ayan itong isa. Babalik ko ‗yung lowest bid. Alam mo ganun ‗yan adre eh. Ang magbabagsak ng lowest bid, ‗yung walang pera. Ang magbabagsak ng lowest bid, sasabihin niya doon sa ano, ―Magbibigay po ako sa inyo.ǁ Kung sinu-sino ‗yang mga opisyal. So, lowest bid papanaluhin siya. So, with no capital, bibigay siya ng pera. Tapos ibigay, lahat bigyan niya, connected --- lahat. Pagkatapos niyan, if it is a 100-million project, he has to pay so many guys, ang naiwan niya 100 --- out of the 100, 40 million lang, so that is the cost of the project.  So, when I was campaigning for the Presidency, I was all over the Philippines. My God, I could see a --- the appropriation, pero ang airport nila, three meters long. So ginawa na lang basketball court. [laughter]  And there is a province here. Hindi kayo, not you. If you look into the records back in time na puro na complex ang roads diyan. Talagang daan dito, daan doon. Pero ‗pag pumunta ka, isang daan lang. It‘s only one highway. That is how corruption destroys the nation.  Ngayon, last. I have to say this. Kailangan ko siya sabihin, sir, eh. I was elected June 30, nag- oath ako. So, July nagpunta na ako sa Davao --- sa AFP Medical Center. Nakwento ko na ba ito sa inyo, hindi pa? Tapos sabi ko --- it‘s quite familiar, kasi I signed a letter nung mayor ako. Sabi ko, ―May MR(I) ba kayo?ǁ Sabi nila, ―Wala, sir.ǁ Sabi ko, ―May state-of-the-art ba kayo na X- ray?ǁ Sabi, ―Wala, sir.ǁ Sabi ko, ―May hyperbaric ba kayo?ǁ That‘s the chamber where you are placed inside if you suffer the bends, ‗yung nagdi-deep dive ka. But it is also high-pressured that can arrest gangrene, especially those who are extracted from the field of battle about two days na, gangrene sets in. So, they are placed there. And it can work miracles for a wounded soldier. So, in one upuan, in one sitting, you did this…  Then, I saw the building and I went inside. Iyong drainage nila, bumabalik. So I said, ―You know, I am really surprised. You‘re military men, why would you allow that kind of…ǁ The dirt is going back to… How do you expect the sailors to --- the soldiers to get well?  Tapos, that‘s the only building. The old --- the oldest. I said, ―Okay, you rehabilitate it. I‘ll give  you a new one in the meantime.ǁ But last month I went to the back of my office, doon sa barracks ng Presidential guards. So, we were groundbreaking for the hospitals of the soldiers. And I asked the soldiers who were there also from V. Luna, ―Are you now using the equipment?ǁAlam mo ang sinagot sa akin, ―Sir, tayo-tayo na lang ang mag-usap huwag na ‗yan sila. T**** i**, wala pa. Hindi pa na-deliver.ǁ Sus.  Sinabi ko, ―If this is the way how you treat our soldiers and they are dying now and that machine was ordered a year ago, and then a coup d‘état, a mutiny is not a surprise to me.ǁ  Kaya sabi ko kay Ubial, hindi niya kasalanan it‘s because of the procurement. Pero ganun… Is Secretary Ubial here? Are you here Secretary? Change the procedure because I will change you.[laughter]  Talagang mag-coup d‘état ‗yan. Marami ng… We are losing about… By this time meron, every - -- everyday we lose about 10? Everyday. Sometimes I say it‘s a useless war. There is a rebellion. Sabi ko maski kung ako ang sundalo niyo and there is a machine already ordered it could have save my leg, tapos wala ma‘am, ay p**** i**, mag-coup d‘état ako.  And let us get the machine by ourselves. I will not be surprised if it‘s already in their minds. Ako, I am only be too willing to step down.  But as a long-term solution, I urge Congress to thoroughly review our existing procurement laws and come up with legislation that will ensure the prompt delivery of quality goods and services to the people, especially medicines and hospital equipment. [applause] Kasi itong military ang sabi ko do not mind COA about I will answer for that. Since COA is here I limit it to three places where the military can buy the equipment. Because I‘m sure that we will work and they can kill the enemies and make even our forces stronger or in parity with what they have on the other side.  Itong armas sabi ko huwag mong sundin ‗yan. I will explain to COA why. Huwag mo akong pabibilhin diyan sa mga lugar ng South America at lahat diyan sa mid-European ----- Eastern European countries are also… There are good ones but I limited them to ---- especially equipment in listening kasi kung magbili ka doon sa iba, nakikinig rin sila, sabay na kayo. Tatlo na kayong nagko-communicate. Tawag sa Bisaya, ―brin.ǁ  Our laws should support, and not impede, national development in a speedy and sustainable manner.  In our bid to accelerate human capital development, we seek to ensure lifelong opportunities by enhancing the quality of and access to education and training programs.  We have sustained investments in higher education and committed to the full implementation of the K to 12 Basic Education Program. We have widened the reach of skills training and increased the number of out-of-school children and youth who have availed of the Alternative Learning System.  To ensure that Filipinos are given equitable access to quality and affordable health services, we expanded health insurance coverage and benefits. The destitute and the indigents, or those who just could not afford hospitalization, can now be provided with free services by government- operated, public hospitals as we have strengthened the implementation of the No Balance Billing Policy. [applause] Kayong mga Pilipino na nakikinig sa akin ngayon magpa- hospital kayo ako ang magbayad tutal hindi naman nila ako mademanda. Pasok lang kayo doon occupy the hospital sabihin mo lang --- totoo ------------------------- pasok kayo ng hospital sabihin ninyo na sabi ni MayorDuterte pagamot daw kami siya daw ang bahala magbayad. [applause] Marami tayong tresurero dito. [Ah huwag na ‗yan iba naman sa taas na.]  I have signed Executive Order No. 26 imposing a ban on smoking in public places to mitigate its consequences. [applause] We want to minimize access to tobacco products, and provide a more supportive environment for those who are attempting to quit tobacco use.  Alam mo bakit? Tinamaan ako ng … ‗Di ba ito, I have been very frank with you. I have a Barrett and I have a Buerger‘s disease, caused by smoking. So ang problema niyan --- in a survey in the Philippines and all over the world, why is it that the women force --- workforce in an office and the men have acquired in equal, almost in parity in numbers sick of cancer.  And it was found out because the poor girl has also to --- inhale your smoke. Kaya [inaudible] ko sa Davao… In Davao you cannot see a person there walking with a cigarette. Foreigners, they are very --- they can argue with you, say that, ―This is my money not your money.ǁ Sabi ko, ―Then, okay. Eat your money or I will shoot your b****.ǁ [laughter]  Investing in the health sector is never a cost to be endured but an opportunity to be explored.  If we are to embrace the vision of a prosperous Philippines, we have to start putting value to our people‘s well-being – because the success of every Filipino‘s pursuit in life, liberty and happiness directly mirrors the fulfilment of our aspirations as a Filipino.  I would like to reiterate my personal and this administration‘s commitment to fully implement the Magna Carta of Women to the barangay level tapos na ito. [applause] To this effect, an executive order will be issued to local government units institutionalizing gender and development programs and services.  We are targeting to increase Government spending on infrastructure from 5 percent of GDP in 2017 to 7 percent of GDP by 2022, amounting to a total of 8 to 9 trillion pesos or 160 [applause] to 180 billion dollars in infrastructure projects. We will make the next few years the ―Golden Age of Infrastructureǁ in the Philippines to enhance our mobility and connectivity, and thereby spur equitable growth and development in the country. In other words, we are going to Build, Build and Build.  To improve our sea connectivity, we launched 15 brand new RORO vessels to ply major nautical routes all over the country. We also opened an ASEAN Ro-Ro Shipping Route connecting the ports of Davao and General Santos, Philippines to Bitung, Indonesia.  To address the congestion in our sea ports, we modernized the Ports of Iloilo, General Santos and Cagayan de Oro and Zamboanga. We shall complete strategic road and bridge projects and some of the road sections shall be widened and improved to address the worsening traffic.  Alam mo si Ma‘am Grace, you are pushing for... You know, when I became President, EDSA was already horrendous as it was a horror of the other administrations.  Now, I brought in Tugade because Tugade to me is a bright boy. He‘s a billionaire. He was my classmate. Ewan ko kung nandito siya. He was our valedictorian in the law class. Talagang mahusay.But we needed money and we tried to get your help to raise money. Ayaw naman ibigay. Eh ‗di hanggang ngayon nandiyan pa ‗yung EDSA. Okay lang, at least gumanda lahat mag-iwan naman tayo ng pangit. We will not make it all smooth in the Philippines. We leave a little alley known as EDSA as the road to perdition.  But anyway since I could not get any funding. I traveled to China and make friends with them, and the ambassador is here, Ambassador Zhao, thank you for the help. And as a matter of fact [applause] willing… He said, ―If your Congress has no money, we will give you the money.ǁ And China has committed to build two bridges to span Pasig River, free of charge. [applause] So that you will be comfortable in crossing Pasig.  Anyway, all of these strategic road and transport projects shall go to naught if we cannot free our streets, which continue to be obstructed by illegally parked vehicles, ‗yang EDSA na ‗yan traffic obstructionists or undisciplined drivers who stop in the middle of the road, and unsanctioned barriers in some areas.  I am directing the MMDA and the LGUs of Metro Manila, as well as the LGUs of Metro Cebu and of all our regional centers, to ensure the free flow of traffic, and immediately clear our roads and thoroughfares of all unnecessary obstruction, including vehicles parked on the streets and barriers --- [applause] [not] sanctioned by the Government, and penalize all traffic obstructionists regardless of stature…  Sometimes hindi mo maano diyan because the police, it‘s a Cabinet member. Pero may I have not --- authorized my Cabinet member to utilize the low plate. Is it not for us to, you just use an ordinary plate, para walang masabi ‗yung tao. I do not want you parking there when there‘s no parking. Please remove…  Airports, we are building new airports. We might get some money also from China and will have new airports in the coming days.  We are now accelerating the implementation of the Communications, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management System project, which will result to on-time arrivals and departures, better managed air traffic, reduced flight operating costs, and safer and more convenient travel experience.  Revenues are the lifeblood of the government, which enable us to provide for the people‘s needs.  Last May 31, 2017, we achieved the first step towards more equitable taxes to fund better services for the people. I commend the House of Representatives [applause] for heeding my urgent certification of the tax reform by passing the first of five packages of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program with an overwhelming 246 votes, representing almost [90] percent of the Filipino people.  The fate of the tax reform is now in the hands of the Senate. Ano bang gustong ninyong gawain, mag-luhod ako niyan? Well, really I‘ll leave it up to you. We are all Filipinos. If you think that‘s a waste, fine. If you think it‘s not good, it‘s okay with me. I can survive.[Next] I call on the Senate to support my tax reform in full and to pass it without haste [applause]. Ayaw man magpakpak --- ah pati si ano wala, they are not clapping so. Si Angara ayaw rin mag-clap. [laughter] Bantay ka lang sa election tingnan mo. [laughter]  These reforms are designed to be pro-poor, especially when the people understand how the revenues will be spent.  The passage of the Tax Reform Law is needed to fund the proposed 2018 budget which I am submitting here and today.  The poor and vulnerable [applause] are at the heart of my tax reform. Your full support will ensure that the benefits of the tax reform can be felt immediately by them.  In the meantime, the Department of Finance and Bureau of Internal Revenue are strengthening and running after tax evaders. [applause]  I have directed the Department of Finance and the BIR to accept Mighty Corporation‘s offer of P25 billion to settle its tax liabilities. [applause] After the settlement, Mighty will no longer engage in the tobacco business.  This will be the biggest tax settlement on record. [applause] It will produce a windfall for government, which is significant, since we face the unexpected costs of rebuilding Marawi and Ormoc.  The acceptance of the tax settlement offer does not preclude other criminal charges against the company that the BIR may decide to file. A settlement will allow government to avoid a long [court] battle that, as we saw in previous cases, could take years to resolve.  Let this be a lesson to others. This administration will spare no one found cheating the government of its due.  We view Information and Communications Technology or ICT as an effective medium to implement positive and meaningful changes in our society.  To this end, my Cabinet approved the National Broadband Plan of 2017 to begin the work of bringing affordable Internet access to every community and improving broadband connectivity in the country.  We have also installed free Wi-Fi Internet in almost 400 public places around the country. [applause] We hope that the public will use them to access important information and services.  The National Government Portal, which we launched recently, will allow faster and easier delivery of public services and reduce the number of visits of the public to agencies for government transactions.  The Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting Migration Plan has also been launched. The switch to digital from analog transmission will not only give a better TV viewing experience but also provide effective and reliable information to Filipinos in times of calamities.The government-owned Salaam Digital TV, the first Muslim TV in the Philippines, is now already on test broadcasting. [applause]  There are some of the things we have done for the past twelve months. A more detailed narrative is contained in my Report to the People, will be released soon. Whether or not my first year of administration was a year of gains or a year of setbacks is not for me to say but for the people to judge. I defer to the people‘s judgment [applause].  My fellow citizens, much remains to be done. Corruption persists like a fishbone stuck in the throat. It pains and it is disconcerting. We need to pry corruption from the government corpus [where it] is deeply embedded. We also need to put an end to squabbles and bickerings within agencies [and] focus fully on the speedy provision of quality public services to our people.  Believe me, it is easier to build from scratch than to dismantle the rotten and rebuild upon its rubble.  Nevertheless, let us work together and lay a new foundation upon which a better Philippines can be reconstructed. Help me build a better tomorrow.  Let me end… Gusto ninyo uwi na tayo? O gusto ninyo ng kwento? Marami pa akong ikwento sa inyo.  Let me end by wishing everyone in the language of the old: ―May God keep us forever sheltered in the hollow of His hand.ǁ  Salamat. [applause]  --- END ---"
file://2017-State-of-the-Nation-Address-of-Rodrigo-Roa-Duterte.pdf,2017-State-of-the-Nation-Address-of-Rodrigo-Roa-Duterte.pdf,"STATE OF THE NATION ADDRESS OF RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES TO THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES SESSION HALL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES  [Delivered at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, Quezon City on July 24, 2017]   Kindly sit down. Thank you for your courtesy. When I was a member of Congress, I ---- my seat was over there. The seat... The lady with a violent --- not violent but rather violet dress --- seated. But I was always absent together with the Speaker and Tonyboy Floirendo, who is still absent until today. [laughter] And that started… Ay nandiyan ba? Sorry. But his propensity started almost 17 years ago when we were members of the 11th Congress.  Senate President Aquilino Pimentel III and the members of the Senate; Pantaleon Alvarez, the Speaker and the members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; Former Presidents Fidel Ramos, Joseph Estrada, and former President Gloria Arroyo; Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno of the Supreme Court and the members of courts; Archbishop Pinto and the distinguished guests of the diplomatic corps; Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; my fellow workers in government; my countrymen.  When I took my oath of office a year or so ago, I knew that our country was reeling from a multitude of problems. That day, there was euphoria in the air resulting from a successful campaign and the thought that dominated my being was to make good on my promise to the people to bring [about change] --- change in government, not a change that is passing but a change that can survive the test of time.  Although I still had to know the magnitude and gravity of the problems, my feeling then was that, equipped with political will and braced by a concerned citizenry, those problems would eventually be bested by us. It was only a matter of determination and collective action. It was only a question of time.  For as I saw it then as I see it now, there is no problem in the world which can stop the march of a people with unflinching and tenacious determination. That was how euphoric --- euphoric it has been.  Early on, I felt that if change was to be meaningful, it had to start with those occupying the highest positions in government because change that comes from below is more transitory than permanent. And I was aiming for permanence. Let change trickle down from [top to] bottom.  It has to be a change that is not confined merely to the replacement of people by people, but a change in the people‘s attitude, disposition and work ethic.  Sadly, although we knew years ago that what was needed or ought to do, we did not do [them] because our idea of government was parochial and we could not rise above family, ethnic andclan loyalties as well as loyalty to friends and co-workers. No one wanted to be a snitch. That is why we are one in saying that genuine change is what this country truly needs.  I believed then, as I believe still, that progress and development will sputter if criminals, illegal drugs, illegal users of drugs are allowed to roam the streets freely, victimizing seeming with impunity, the innocent and the helpless. Worse yet, there were times in the past when the protectors of the people were themselves the perpetrators of the very crimes they were tasked to prevent or suppress. It is ironic as it is madness.  I have learned that economy surges only when there is peace and order prevailing in places where investors can pour [in] their capital and expertise. I have learned from my experience in Davao City that investor confidence [is] bolstered and fortified only if a potent force and mechanism for [the] protection of local and foreign investments are in place.  That is why, I have resolved that no matter how long it takes, the fight against illegal drugs will continue because that is the root cause of so much evil and so much suffering [applause] that weakens the social fabric and deters foreign investments from pouring in. The fight will be unremitting as it will be unrelenting.  Despite international and local pressures, the fight will not stop [applause] until those who deal in it understand that they have to cease, they have to stop because the alternatives are either jail or hell. [applause] And I will make sure, very sure that they will not have the luxury of enjoying the benefits of their greed and madness.  I do not intend to loosen the leash in the campaign or lose the fight against illegal drugs. Neither do I intend to preside over the destruction of the Filipino youth by being timid and tentative in my decisions and actions. [applause]  To the critics against this fight, your efforts will be better spent if you use the influence, moral authority and ascendancy of your organizations over your respective sectors to educate the people on the evils of illegal drugs instead of condemning the authorities and unjustly blaming for every killing that bloodies this country.  But don‘t get me wrong. I value human life the way I value mine. Each life that is snuffed out translates into future generations lost. It is like cracking the acorn from which an oak tree grows - which, in turn, produce the seeds to complete the cycle of [life in] perpetuity.  There is a jungle out there. There are beasts and vultures preying on the helpless, the innocent [and] the unsuspecting. I will not allow the ruin of the youth, the disintegration of families and the retrogression of communities, forced by criminals whose greed for money is as insatiable as it is devoid of moral purpose. Neither will I be immobilized into inaction by the fear that I will commit an act that will expose me to public condemnation or legal prosecution. You harm the children in whose hands the future of this Republic is entrusted, and I will hound you to the very gates of hell. [applause]  That is why I ask you to join me in this fight against illegal drugs and all forms of criminality.  The government, equipped with legal authority, and you, with the moral ascendancy over the sector you represent, can do so much, and hopefully eradicate this social scourge that plagues us no end.Look beyond your biases, your prejudices, your ambition [and] your political agenda. The search for change will begin and end only when we look into ourselves and find it within.  Today, a multitude of problems confront us. No sooner is one problem solved [when] another surges forth in its place. But we will not be disheartened; we will not be cowed; we will not be overwhelmed.  It is during trying times and troubled events that the resilience, perseverance and determination of the people are tested. The Filipino is no stranger or neophyte to situations like the one we face today. We can, and we will, overcome as we did countless times in the past, [but] only if we work together towards a common goal.  Sad to say, despite all efforts, peace, especially in the Island of Mindanao, continues to elude us. But of course, it is not the peace of the dead but the peace of the living that we seek. Peace flits away like a butterfly when you try to snatch it by the wings. And our pursuit of peace continues.  The red insurgency has been with us for decades; the Muslim issue, for centuries.  So much time has lapsed, so many lives have been lost and so much destruction has been wrought but peace eludes us still. Sometimes I am almost tempted to conclude that peace might not be able to come during our lifetime.  But believe me, it will not be for want of trying. And I will persist in our goal of attaining peace [up] to the last day of this administration and maybe even beyond although in a different capacity. [applause]  There is rebellion in Mindanao. The extremists have declared it their purpose to establish a caliphate within Philippine territory along the teachings and beliefs of [the] Islamic State of Iraq and Syria or otherwise known as ISIS. The battle of Marawi has dealt a terrible blow to our quest for peace especially now that an alien ideology and a radical shift in purpose have been injected into the local setting.  I declared Martial Law in Mindanao because I believed that that was the fastest way to quell the rebellion at the least cost of lives and properties. [applause] At the same time, the government would be adequately equipped with the constitutional tool not only to prevent the escape of rebels who can easily mingle and pretend to be civilian evacuees only to re-group in another place to fight another day, but also to prevent them from spreading their gospel of hate and violence in the rest of Mindanao.  Martial Law and the suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus enable the military to arrest, detain and question suspected members and sympathizers of the rebellion similar to what happened to the parents of the Maute brothers.  As president, I am reiterating my unwavering support and commitment to the soldiers of our Armed Forces and the members of our police force --- [applause] those who are on the ground and in the battlefields and those who are risking their lives for our country and our democracy. I have your backs. To those who oppose and think that all these efforts are out of order, I hold myself --- me and me alone should be responsible. [applause]The people of Marawi need help. Caught in the crossfire between government troops and Muslim extremists, they have been through hell and we need to help them rise and move forward.  If we cannot provide for the poor and the needy who are many, then we will not be able to keep from harm the rich who are few.  At the vanguard of our struggle for peace and order are our Armed Forces and Police. They are the silent heroes who risk their lives everyday for our country‘s security. In recognition of their valor, we have crafted a program to provide them with comprehensive social assistance, including financial, should they meet harm in the performance of their duty. For the family left behind by those who fell or are rendered totally disabled in the line of duty, we shall provide shelter, health care assistance, education, and employment. That is my way of telling our troops: never fear, do your duty. I stand behind you. So does this government and all its agencies. [applause]  To decisively address insurgency and terrorism, we are working doubly hard towards [achieving] a stronger and more credible national defense system for the country. We continue to strengthen the defense capability of the AFP as a deterrence against terrorists, lawless elements, and other threats.  My fellow citizens, what I have said so far about the events in Marawi and its neighboring environs is only a part of a looming problem, which will cut across all classes and all sectors of society and eventually affect the entire country from north to south, from east to west, given the fact that Mindanao supplies a great part of our country‘s food requirements. I refer to climate change, which could bring drought and long dry spells affecting food production in Mindanao, given the fact that Mindanao is unusually warming. I ask all agencies involved in food production to look into this and act accordingly.  Also, I am appealing to all our legislators to immediately pass the National Land Use Act or NALUA [applause] to ensure the rational and sustainable use of our land and our physical resources, given the competing needs of food security, housing, businesses and environmental conservation.  Ours is a rich country. Wealth that this country is endowed with [is] a gift from God to be utilized for the [people‘s] welfare and the common good. I do not believe that this gift was given to us to be merely viewed or appreciated, but to be extracted from the earth and utilized to make life worth living.  That is why I say that it is not enough that we mine this wealth. What is more important is that we convert the raw material thereof into finished products for international and local purposes.[applause] That way, it will not only be the few who are the rich but also the poor who are many who will benefit therefrom.  Therefore, I call on our industrialists, investors [and] commercial barons to put up factories and manufacturing establishments right here in the Philippines to process our raw materials into finished products. [applause]  At this point in my administration, if possible, we shall put a stop to the extraction and exportation of our mineral resources to foreign nations [applause] for processing abroad andimporting them back to the Philippines in the form of consumer goods at prices twice or thrice the value of the original raw materials foreign corporations pay for them.  However, in the extraction and utilization of these resources, extreme care must be exercised [applause] that we do not recklessly and needlessly harm the environment. [applause] Responsible, regulated and sustainable development is what we advocate and require. The protection of the environment must be made a priority[applause] ahead of mining and all other activities that adversely affect one way or another. And this policy is non-negotiable.[applause]  I sternly warn… I am warning all mining operations and contractors to refrain from the unbridled and irresponsible destruction of our watersheds, forests, and aquatic resources. You have gained much from mining, we only get about 70 billion a year, but you have considerably neglected your responsibility to protect and preserve --- and even the tax, it‘s about five percent --- environment for posterity.  I am holding all mining companies and its officials responsible for the full and quick clean-up, restoration [and] rehabilitation of all areas damaged by mining activities, and the extension of all necessary support to the communities that have suffered mining‘s disastrous effects on their health, [applause] livelihood, and environment, among others.  Ganito ‗yan eh. Medyo alis muna ako diyan sa… Sasakit ang mata ko diyan sa y*** na ‗yan. [laughter] Alam mo, you have the mining. I have to grant you a mining because you have complied with all the requirements of the law. And I cannot… I‘d be subject to a mandamus if everything is perfect and you have every right to mine. But in doing so, you destroy the rivers, you destroy the streams, from which the poor people fish --- halwan or mudfish --- and that is protein for the day for them.  Ngayon makita mo naman not only Gina Lopez gave you a clear picture of what was happening horrendously. Nakita mo kay Ted Failon --- ‗yung kay Ted Failon, talagang nanood ako, dalawang beses. And I realized that I have to do something about it as a Filipino. [applause]  Alam mo, okay na ‗yung mining. Subsidiary ka lang ng isang another giant corporation or you‘re a sister company of a telecommunication, hindi kayo magugutom. But look at the picture shown to you. For once, they behaved correctly ang ABS-CBN. Tingnan mo ‗yung pelikula ni Ted Failon. I salute him for coming with it. [applause]  You see the palayan… Ang palayan tumuyo at ang soil nag-crack. So the farmers cannot eat anymore. They are reduced to the garbage of what you can get there, salvage anything and sell it to the scrap. Ganun ang nangyari sa Pilipino. Hindi ko kayo kalaban. As a matter of fact, you give government almost 70 billion. Pero actually maliit lang ‗yan.  Ngayon, nakikita ninyo itong mga palayan na tumutuyo and the rivers wala ng isda. The only source of protein. Hindi ka naman pwedeng mag-hunting. May makita kang eagle diyan, barilin mo, preso ka. Pakainin mo ‗yung… Saan mo ipa…?  Try to go out, sumama tayo --- kayo sa akin. And try to see how hard it is for them to survive. Now ito ang… Gusto mo ganito ang pangyayari, tutal sobra-sobra naman ‗yang pera ninyo, adre, sa totoo lang. Mayor ako eh, I can look at your corporate earnings, your sister company, I can pierce the corporate identity, kayo rin pala. And even diyan sa mga newspaper. When you are not supposedto… You know, ‗pag newspaper ka you are supposed to be 100 percentFilipino. And yet when you start to pierce their identity, it is pala fully owned by Americans. Ganun ang nangyari eh. It‘s just a matter of piercing the…  So wala masyado ako… ABS, Rappler kayo ba ‗yan? Have you tried to pierce your identity and it will lead you to America? Do you know that? And yet the constitution requires you to be 100 percent --- media --- Filipino. Rappler, try to pierce the identity and you will end up American ownership. Mayaman na kayo, mga mining companies. Ito ang deal ko sa inyo, either I will raise the taxes, ang kumikita niyan i-reserve ko to compensate for those who are suffering and in agony. [applause]  You have to come up with a substitute, either spend to restore the virginity of their source or I will tax you to death.[applause] Kasi ‗yung taxes makuha ko, talagang ibubuhos ko. Ngayon, if you can make an arrangement, an inventory of the --- ‗yung nasira --- ‗yung mga tao nagutom pati ‗yung river nila wala nang makuha because… You know guys, kayong mga taga-Davao we are not new to it, you want to see horror in your lifetime? Akong bahala. NPA huwag muna kayong magpagara-gara diyan, away-away kay magpunta kami samahan ko sila. You stop your --- puro hambog lang kayo diyan. Punta tayo doon sa Diwalwal, doon sa [inaudible] and I will show you the river. Up there at the source, it‘s so pristine. But doon sa --- right at the start of the boundary where the millings are started, the water there is not clear, it is not brown, it is black. Your one peso will win one million from me if I am lying. Kung gusto mo isama ko kayo bukas doon. Ngayon, ‗pag tinarget tayo ng mga g***** NPA na ‗yan eh problema natin ‗yan lahat. Sabay-sabay na lang tayo. Bakante ang presidency, bakante ang Senado pati ang congressman. Pero totoo ‗yan, you should visit the… Even the first spade, even the first spade full of earth that you extract and throw it away of no use. Itabi mo lang ‗yan diyan eh because it‘s an open pit, you dig and dig and dig, is already the first spade there is the decreasing of Mother Earth.  Alam mo ang isa pang galit sa mining? Si Speaker. He comes from a mining town but he hates mining. Ako naman kasi mga kaibigan ko ‗yung iba, ‗yung mga classmate ko mga vice president ng mining, magpunta sila dito… But it reduces into something --- the damage that you have caused. It‘s not about our friendship. It‘s not about years of being in the same room. It‘s not about being fraternity brothers. But it is something that… [raises his right hand] Ganun ‗yan eh.  Alam mo ‗yung martial law, I am not so much endeavored diyan sabihin ninyo na hindi ninyo ibigay? Okay lang. Wala akong problema diyan. Maski sabihin ninyo na tama na? Okay lang. Then I will still fight. The way I will fight the war. If it is not acceptable to the normal of civilian conduct, then I am sorry because I am not fighting a civilian war, I am stopping violence and rebellion.[applause] Hindi talaga ako…  Ibigay man ninyo o hindi, para sa akin wala. Because ako, I do not intend to go beyond my term. As a matter of fact, mas gusto kong barilin ako doon sa likod. Eh hindi masyado ako itong bilib itong trabahong ito? Akala ko bilib ako. Pagdating ko ah l****, sakit ng ulo. [applause]  Totoo. Kayo nakikinig kayo. Wala akong pinirmahan ni isa, p**** i**** ‗yan na para pagkain. Pagkain-pagkain sa opisina, eh bayaran ninyo ‗yan. Maglabas ako. I do not collect anything. I do not remember. I do not sign anything there until now. Wala akong allowance wala akong tinatanggap lahat except my salary. Tapos dalawang pamilya pa ang maghati. Anong masama niyan? [applause and cheers] Sige kayo pakpak diyan. Lahat naman tayo. [laughter] I can count my… Not even the two hands, one hand lang na exempted sa rule na ‗yan. Dalawa, tatlo, apat, lima. Lokohin ninyo ako, ba‘t tayo pa ba ang maglokohan? Just because this is Congress it hasto be a secret, secret. Maniwala kayong mga ito? Pareho kaming lahat niyan. Ayaw pa tumawa kunwari. [laughter and applause]  So I will increase the taxes. Then I will think of something that will compensate or make up for the damage or at least the income restored. Otherwise, I‘ll have to stop mining. I will ask you to stop it. It‘s not good. We are a small group of islands, hindi naman marami. The coastal, marami ‗yan kasi marami paikot-ikot, but we are in a contiguous territory, maliit lang tayo.  You must remember that there are so many billions of the future generations waiting in this stratosphere. Ang gusto ninyo para hindi na kayo mandamay, huminto na kayo ng ano. Then let us go to… Because this will not end here. How about the billions and billions and billions of Filipinos who will come after us? Kawawa naman. They‘ll have to scratch Mother Earth to eat. By this time kung walang upheaval, no regeneration will occur, we are almost like talagang ginaganun natin ang --- maliit na lang ang makuha nila. But maawa naman kayo. Makikita mo ‗yung apo mo kung ganun mo na lang… Kung ganun mo na lang ‗yung --- embrace mo ‗yung apo mo sa pangalawang asawa. ‗Yung isa ganun rin. ‗Di ba? ‗Di ba, sir?[laughter] Suntukin kita diyan ngayon, liar ka.  Finally, let me make this appeal to those directly engaged in mining. Declare your correct income [and] pay your correct taxes. Believe me, your failure to do so will be your undoing and eventual ruin. [applause]  Hindi na ako makatakbo, matanda na ako. I don‘t think I‘ll even survive the five years. Pero pagka sinabi ko upakan kita, upakan talaga kita.  To our employees and officials of the LGUs tasked with monitoring these mining operations within their territorial jurisdictions, do your job without fear or favor. I [hold] you absolutely responsible for any misdeed or failure [by] the mining entities to comply --- do not comply or comply with the guidelines, rules and regulations governing mining operations and activities within your area of responsibility. I mean it. Do not try to test my resolve. Absolutely I have nothing to lose except my life.  While we can control the acts of man, no one can control [or] stop the fury and rampage of weather gone wild. When nature fights back, it does so with a vengeance.  We have seen the terrible toll that Super typhoon Yolanda and the succeeding typhoons exacted in terms of human life and property. And we still have to recover from the beating that we got both during and in the aftermath of those mega-typhoons.  Aside from droughts, tempests and other problems taking shape which, according to DOST- PHIVOLCS --- it is no longer just a distant possibility but a probability: Earthquakes.  The series of damaging quakes in Leyte, Surigao and nearby provinces and islands attest to this. We were told that it is no longer a question of ―ifǁ but a matter of ―when.ǁ  Thus, we need to act decisively and fast because the threat is huge, real and imminent.  Come to think of it really, they say that there is no perfect instrument or human acumen can really predict earthquake. I hope it will not come. Kasi kung magdating ‗yung sabi nila ‗yung ―Big Oneǁ, Ihope it will be just in the mountains and in the rural areas. Because if it‘s right --- sabihinnila tinatakot nila ang… Media kasi… Nandito eh in the speech, I reviewed it last night. I am calling [on] both houses of Congress to expeditiously craft a law establishing a new authority or department that is responsive to the prevailing 21st century conditions and empowered to best deliver [an] enhanced disaster resiliency and quick disaster response.  While the law is [being] crafted with extreme urgency, we need to undertake immediate action to ensure disaster resiliency and effective response in the greater [Metro] Manila area, which is our country‘s seat of governance, center of business, commerce, and the academe. Disaster resiliency of Metro Manila and the surrounding provinces is a matter of urgent [national ] concern.  Iyon nandito ‗yan, tinatakot nila dito because of the high-rise buildings and… Ilang tao ang nakatira diyan? Kung… Kaya kaya ito sa isang sinkhole? I mean if it cracks and it goes down, can we still manage to go up? God, huwag ngayon ha kay nandito ako. Hintayin mo lang ‗yan sila na lang sila dito nag-aaway. [laughter]  I am directing the Cabinet Cluster on Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management to immediately work hand in hand with the concerned LGUs, the private sector and the affected communities themselves, in undertaking disaster [resiliency] measures, antidotes.  We all need to act fast.  With all the foregoing said, what then is the state of the nation today?  I will mince no words and neither will I window-dress the situation [that] we are in. Let me answer in two brief sentences. We are in --- for trouble --- because we live in troubled and uncertain times. And I fear that things might get worse before they become better. But like I said I hope we will cope, we hope and pray.  The West Philippine Sea issue and Federalism are matters that we have to tackle sooner or later.  On the other hand, despite our recent gains in improving the peace and order situation in the country, there is still so much to be desired and if we are to completely eradicate the menace of illegal drugs, criminality and corruption, we must do it.  I therefore ask Congress to act on all pending legislations to reimpose the death penalty on heinous crimes — especially on the trafficking of illegal drugs.  There is a shortage… No, no, no. There is a short clip of CNN about people in Massachusetts, was it there? Iyong clip nila ang ipinakita. Tiningnan… Pakitingin lang… It‘s repeated for almost every week yata ‗yang mga short clips. Tingnan mo ‗yung mga tao doon na hinayaan nilang mag… They are there, they live under the bridge, they are getting thin, they are doing nothing. Nakaganun lang sila tapos po-pose ng ano… And they are aplenty there. They do not work, wala.  Tapos sabi ng UN… Is he here? Are you there iyong UN representative? Na sinabi mo na shabu will not affect the brain? Are you here? Raise your right hand, if you‘re here. Do not worry. I will just… Do not --- the word ―deludeǁ as into you… Iyong mga ano ninyo na --- but weknow everyday that one family raped, dalawa and all are dead. Then you trivialize it with human rights and due process. Okay ako niyan. When you go into an anger, when you burst with rage, okay ‗yan. But with so many killings as brutal and as cruel as what happened, if you add human rights and due process, you stink and your mouth smells. If you want to criticize, criticize, condemn the act, stop there. But do not give the excuse or do not make it trivial by saying human rights at least we‘ll be protected... Iyan ang pinakab***** na magawa ng isang tao. When you criticize, stick on one topic. Then you find an event where you can talk about human rights and due process, but do not talk about it in the same time when there is a carnage and you begin to blabber, talk about human rights. Lalong nagagalit ang tao. Eh p****** i** mo. May namatay na diyan, akala mo kung sino ka. [applause] What have you done in the name of human rights? Seventy-seven --- you have the records. You can summon the police. Seventy- seven before I became president. All drug- related, 77,000. And you trivialize that with a conference… At tsaka pumunta dito ang tatanungin ‗yung nasa presuhan na pinireso dahil nag - -- just imagine…  I challenge you, you want a debate in public? Okay, we‘ll have it. I will challenge you how also you trivialize the thing by --- ‗yung binibigyan niyo ng importansiya si De Lima. You all know, you were all here. You conducted the investigation. You heard the witnesses. You saw the videos. Is she a credible woman? Can she be a moral person? [applause] Puro kayo drama diyan sa…  When you talk about an incident, talk about it, then condemn, condemn the police. But do not connect it with due process and human rights. Mag-mukha kang g*** sa harap ng Pilipino. You know why I get this rating? I could not be brighter than you and my work is not more important or your vocation is not less than mine. But when you talk in public carry the proper message. Kaya mag-82 kayo or kaya binobombahan niyo kasi ako ng ganun. Sasabihin naman ng mga tao, ―Eh tama ‗yan. Tama ‗yan si Duterte.ǁ Kasi nangyayari eh. Eh kayo man ang front sa pa- ganun-ganun, eh ‗pag may namatay diyan na maraming massacre, ni-rape mga babae, bata, hindi kayo umiimik. [applause] Maya-maya pagdating ng mga --- [applause and cheers] pagdating nitong mga Western expert kuno, you give them so much premium and importance. Saan ba ang utak ninyo? Bakit kayo bilib diyan sa puti? Tingnan mo ang puti, panahon ni Obama, una ‗yung spokesman ng State Department. Akala mo kung sino. Akala nila mas bright pa sila sa akin. Then the staff of the President, then Obama. ―I would like to remind Mr. Duterte that the policy of…ǁ Eh ‗di yari ako. Pagdating ni Trump, ―Oh yes, Mr. President, I‘ve been expecting your call. You are doing it all right… And this G*******…ǁ [applause] Uwi na ako. T**** i*** ‗yan.  So? That‘s the value of the country that you value. Ambivalent. Parang electric fan. Okay dito o hindi na okay, it‘s vacillating. Tapos kayong mga --- bilib kayo. Hindi ko talaga maintindihan ang Pilipino. It takes for an American to say that I‘m a son of a b****. And it takes for an American to say, ―Oh you‘re great. You‘re a hero in your country.ǁ O saan ako pumunta dito ngayon? [laughter]  It is time for us to fulfill our mandate to protect our people from these crimes that have victimized… You know, huwag ninyo akong takot-takutin niyang preso ‗yung international court of justice. S***, I am willing to go to prison for the rest of my life. Ang importante sa akin ginagaw ko ‗yung gusto ko. [applause]  Alam mo kasi in this country it is a rule of majority. I did it for the 50 plus one because in a vote of 100, I get 51, 50 plus one. Fifty is one-half, one, that is majority of one, I win. ‗Yung 49, ‗yon ‗yung mga… I do not have to make them happy. But when the time comes, eh kung malasinako, pupunta ako sa presuhan, do not worry about me. I can take it. Noong maliit pa ako, labas- pasok ako sa… Wala pa ‗yang law ni Pangilinan. Labas-pasok na ako sa presuhan. Kunin ninyo ‗yung record sa pulis doon sa Davao. Takutin na, ―He will be prosecuted.ǁ Hoy, abogado ako because I will…  Sabi ko nga, everybody is entitled to come here and question me, but I have to question you also. At para magaling, let us make it official. We go to court and we tell the judge that we are hearing by an international body, can we have it judicially recorded? And I will place them under oath. Mahuli ko man talaga ‗yan sila. May pinatay ako, tama ‗yan. When I was mayor, a little over… For 23 years ako mayor ng Davao eh. Makita mo ang Davao ngayon, you have been LGUs before. What city is now hitting nine growth percent? Eh nandoon pa kami sa Mindanao, binobomba pa kami sa Davao. Davao is nine growth. Tapos sabihin ninyo… Ngayon, paano ngayon i-nine mo ‗yung --- palabas mo itong nine we are about to hit six or so, sabi nila. Pero ‗pag hayaan mo lang ako, mag-abot ito ng 21, the highest in the world. [applause] Kayo lang ang taga-pigil eh.  It is time for us to fulfill our mandate to protect… Tapos na ‗yan. Kindly… For so long… We have to act decisively on this contentious issue.  Capital punishment is not only about deterrence. It is also about retribution. Make no mistake about that.  Iba kasi ako eh. Let us understand each other including the international community. Ang aming --- our criminal system uses the Revised Penal Code. That is a law that was given to us by the Spaniards, the original Revised Penal Code. Though it was translated into English and in this two books, three books, there are the definition of crimes and the penalties and everything. And the thrust of that Revised Penal Code, ladies and gentlemen, is the essence of retribution. That is why you have penalties. There is also the word ―positivist theoryǁ that you can nurture a criminal into goodness provided he goes to prison for two years, three years, he‘s released, he‘s a sex offender. When he goes out, he rapes again, kidnaps another girl and makes her a hostage for so many years. Ganun kayo eh. Admit it, ganun kayo. You are so too lenient about this son of a b****, a human being that has a virulent brain and his enemy is society.  And many at times, there were sex offenders in America released only to rape and kidnap again and kill in just a few months after release. In the Philippines, it is really an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. You took a life then you must pay for life. That is the only way to even. You cannot place a premium on the human mind that he will go straight. Nobody can. Not even your best scientist. No one has ever fathomed how a person would react especially in committing crimes. That‘s the only way to do it to instill fear, that if you do it, you will die. That‘s the advantage of criminals and rebels and terrorists because they think that you are afraid to die.  That‘s why when I went to Marawi, I was asked by the media, ―Why are you here?ǁ ―I am here because my soldiers are here and I came here to die also.ǁ [applause] Because any battle, any fierce encounter, you have to be of equal equanimity. Gusto siyang mamatay, eh ‗di gusto ko ring mamatay.  They say that they use the name of God, and the Christians say, ―we have the same thing.ǁ I read the Ecclesiastes 3. What does it say? Even during elections, there is a time to be great and a time for defeat. A time to be in the skies, emblazoned there and a time to be [inaudible] somebody. A time to have money, a time to be hard up. A time to just walk so many kilometersto school and a time for graduation and being a lawyer. A time to be… I don‘t know what I am now. There‗s always a time. [laughter and applause]  Ganun ‗yan eh. So I‘ll match you. ‗Pag sinabi mong, ―Gusto kong mamatay.ǁ Anak ka ng… Dalawa tayo. This bully, you know I had dinner with them sa Bayan. Itong NDF because I used to be friends really with the NDF. I was crossing the ideological borders before. Ako ‗yung nakakapasok sa teritoryo and we were friends really. But times have changed because God placed me here and I take care of a Republic. Sabi nila doon ―bullyǁ daw ako. T******* pala kayo, talagang bully ako. [laughter and applause] P***** i**. Talagang bully ako especially to the enemies of the state, talagang bully ako. [applause]  Ito pa, sabi ko sa mga sundalo, ‗yung mga human rights na ano, you are flying everywhere, anywhere ‗yung mga utak ninyo. I said, ―Take no prisoners.ǁ Which is [garbled] --- ―kill themǁ. Which is correct? But you don‘t listen to my speech. This media --- lalo na itong ABS --- kunin lang ‗yang, ―kill them.ǁ [laughter]  ‗Yan ang problema ninyo kaya minura ko kayo. Walang Presidente na p*******i** kayo because you are not behaving. Now you‘re asking me for talks… [applause and cheers] When you publish in the newspaper or quote us in media, itong mga reporters would only quote ―kill them.ǁ  I said, ―Kill them in a fight. If you have to shoot them, shoot them at the heart or the head.ǁ Sabi ko. Why? Because they will be detained here in Marawi, wala tayong presuhan. [laughter] ngayon, and the courts will always insist that they will be --- that‘s the law --- that they will be tried and detained in the place where they committed the crime. Kaya huwag kayong mag --- patayin talaga ninyo, kasi ilagay natin ‗yan diyan sa barracks natin diyan, sa ating Mechanized Division. Pag-eskapo niyan, dalhin ‗yung kanyon natin, ipaputok pa sa atin. [laughter] Marami. How many jail --- [anong tawag dito?] --- jailbreaks in Mindanao, in Cotabato alone? Six. Cotabato City, four. Ang jail doon, nire-raid tapos pinapalabas.  Alam ba ninyo ‗yan? Because you do not publish. Or itong mga taga-Maynila… Hindi kayo, mga bright kayo, bilib ako. Mga g****g****. Sabi na ―Why do you…?ǁ Why? What happened last April in Davao? It was bombed. How many were killed? Twenty-seven. Few years ago, the church was bombed twice. How many died? Fifty-nine. The airport just as the people were coming out of the departure --- ah arrival --- it was bombed. How many died? Thirty-two. In the war, three nuns were lining up there. I had to scoop the brain of the nun to put it in a can because the face was shattered. Zamboanga. And you say that the violation is only in Marawi? Torpe. Talaga kayong… Mag-usap tayo ngayon. Dalhin ko kayo doon sa mga biyuda. Kailan lang ‗yun?  Huwag niyong sabihin na ―It‘s only in Marawi.ǁ Rebellion has been going on in Mindanao. Walang sinasanto doon. Hindi lang ninyo binabasa nang husto. What‘s the… It‘s very porous. Kung separate islands ‗yan, maybe. Kung separate ‗yan --- very porous, they can go… And Mindanao --- this is not to… The Moro has nothing to do with it, pareho tayo. Pareho tayong Maranao, so just shut up. Huwag kayong ma… Ito ang totoo.  Maraming Muslim sa Mindanao. Lahat… Eh sa Abra, meron eh. In this fight… Well, where do you think the Moro would side? Kung patayan na. They will side with government? Kung ako ngayon, kung nakatira ako, hindi kami umalis ng --- hindi ako dinala ng nanay ko sa labas. I‘ll be a resident of Marawi, what do you think will be my sentiment? Sulu. Davao, puro Muslim enclaves ‗yan, there are enclaves, parang baryo-baryo. Kapag sentimiyento ang putukan, magputok ‗yan sabay-sabay.On another thing, I‘ll talk it about in the conference. Sumobra itong Left eh. Maggawa ka ng bahay --- nakawin. Ang sabi ko sa sundalo, ―Do not force the issue. I will just build yours. Ibigay mo na lang.ǁ  May project ngayon, gusto na naman nilang kuhanin. Do not commit that mistake. Here and now, I will tell you, including the Congress of the Republic of the Philippines: You do anarchy, I will order the soldiers and the police to shoot. Even if I have to bury thousand of Filipinos. Huwag ninyo akong ganunin.  Either you‘re… Either… Let us understand this beginning today, either we have laws in this country or we do not. We enforce the laws against the miners and the rich, but I will also enforce laws against anarchy, disturbance, and create trouble. Kayo rin, natatakot din eh. [applause]  Takutin ninyo ako na occupy the streets? Anak ng jueteng. You stay there, you ask for two days, I will give you six months. Huwag kayong umalis diyan. Kainin ninyo pati ‗yung dumi ninyo diyan.  Takut-takutin mo ang gobyerno. I‘m sorry I‘ve exceeded my time, but… Eh kailangan kong sabihin eh. Para maintindihan din nila. Tutal nandito na lang rin ako sa media. Nakikinig pati lahat. Kayong mga Left, I will not talk to you. Why should I? [applause] Huwag mo na akong pilitin na magpatayo kayo mga pro-poor, shut up. Wait for two years, because I have…  You know, this is my proposal. I may be totally wrong and I will accept it, but this is mine. From now on, I will save money for the Armed Forces of the Philippines. We have lost so much soldiers.[applause] And there are thousands already incapacitated to fight. Pati ‗yung police ko, araw-araw ninyong ina-ambush. Pati ang convoy ko, kasi doon ako mag-sakay, in-aambush nila.  Pati akong --- g***. P*****i**, pati ako, patayin nila. Sabagay, malayo ako doon. Pero convoy ko kasi ‗yun eh. Waiting lang ako doon sa ano… Alam mo ginamitan niyo ng machine gun. Kaya lang armorized.  Kayong mga congressman, senador na ayaw ninyong --- baka may kalaban kayo. Asawa ba ninyo ‗yung katira ninyo ngayon?[laughter] O inagaw ninyo? Pa-armorize ninyo. Totoo. Proven, M60.[applause] Si… Si Senator Drilon, M60, sir. Hindi talaga ‗to maalis. Kasi binara na nila. Nasira na lang ‗yung --- ‗di talaga nila. And the soldiers inside were all there all the time, mina- machine gun na, hindi tatalab.  Mga g***, pati ‗yung convoy ko, ambushin. Hindi nila alam na nakasibat na ako. [applause] Kaya gusto niyo kong mag-usap tayo, no, sumobra kayo. Ikaw, Sison, tang … Mag-inom ka ng Tang ‗yung orange. [laughter] Matanda ka na. Kayong Pilipinas, makinig, buong Pilipinas. Kayong mga bata, kayong mga Lumad natives, itong matatanda na ito, Sison is sick. May colon cancer. Ang gastos ng Norway, sumurender na siya. Kasi naging isyu sa pulitika eh. This government who sponsored those --- who provided the good offices. Matatalo sa eleksyon dahil sa issue diyan. Kasi pabalik-balik ang mga b****, kala mo mga turista. Wala namang pinag-uusapan.  Pagdating dito, gusto ng ganito, gusto ng ganyan, ah l*** mo.[laughter] Huwag mong sabihin ‗yung meaning doon sa mga bisita. Napura na ako ba. Talagang ano ako, sir. Masyadong demanding, ni hindi naman kayo nanalo ng elections ni minsan. You cannot even hang on into abarangay. And you keep on killing people, hindi lang ‗yung mga pulis, pati ‗yung mga civilians na ayaw magsali sa kanila.  Kaya sabi ko ano --- sabi ko talaga, ―buang ka.ǁ And sinabi ko talaga. Pardon pa si…. Pi****** i** ko talaga siya the other day sa Davao. Sinong tinatakot ninyo? Katanda-tanda na ninyo eh. At lahat tayo mamatay. Kayong mga naiwan diyan sa kalsada, mabuti pa umuwi kayo. Wala kayong makuha diyan sa komunista.[applause]  Do you think that if the ISIS prevails in this country that you will have a place in their society? You must be awfully stupid, as stupid. [applause] Wala kayong makuha. Lahat tayo damay. Thank you for allowing the exhaust dito.  In our sustained effort to achieve just and lasting peace[laughter and applause]… Class, be courteous. Do not make a noise. The visitors are listening. [laughter] Just and lasting peace for a [unified] nation, we are pursuing an inclusive peace process, promoting the participation of all stakeholders, including those conflict-affected areas.  We took steps to promote inclusiveness in the Bangsamoro Transition Commission (BTC) by expanding its membership through Executive Order Number 8 which I signed in November last year.  By giving representation to indigenous peoples, women, children, and sultanates, and key stakeholders in the drafting of the Bangsa[moro] Basic Law, we ensure a Bangsamoro government that truly reflects the aspirations of our Muslim brothers and sisters as well as our indigenous brethren. [applause]  We have embarked on various initiatives to advance our national interest in the global community. We pursue good relations with all nations anchored on an independent --- on an independent foreign policy [applause] --- and the basic tenets of sovereign equality, mutual respect and non-interference. [applause]  As an independent nation, we will uphold and promote our national interests in the international community. We will strengthen and seek partnership with those who share our values. We will engage nations with full respect for the rule of law, sovereign equality, and again, non- interference. These are the principles that we are upholding as we advance to this year for the meeting as the Chair of the ASEAN.  We have cultivated warmer relations with China through bilateral dialogues and other mechanisms, leading to easing of tensions between the two countries and improved negotiating environment on the West Philippine Sea.  At this point, allow me to take a step back in time, in 1901. In 1901, there was known as Balangiga, and that is Eastern Samar. It was the time for Philippine-American War.  A combined group of Filipino villagers and guerrillas, in an effort to defend Samar Island from the alien invaders, attacked and overwhelmed a U.S. --- a United States infantry garrison. Forty- eight American officers and men were slain in the attack. On the Filipino side, the casualty count was twenty-eight killed and twenty-two wounded.In retaliation, U.S. gunboats and patrols were sent to Balangiga, Samar with the order to ―…make a desert of Balangigaǁ and to reduce Samar Island into an island of ―howling wilderness,ǁ where every male citizen from the age of ten and above, and capable of bearing arms, would be put to death. The Church bells of Balangiga were seized by the Americans as spoils of war.  Those bells are reminders of the gallantry and heroism of our forebears who resisted the American colonizers and sacrificed their lives in the process. Krag against bolo --- krag was the standard rifle issued to the American troops. And that is how the historians describe.  [Nauna ka, pababa mo. Hindi, baba mo, tumataas ‗yan.][laughter] Mahirap talag kung director ka, ikaw pa ang speech.[laughter] Many historians describe --- [sige] the Philippine-American war. That is why I say today; give us back those Balangiga bells. [applause] They are ours. They belong to the Philippines. [applause] They are part of our national heritage. [applause] Isauli naman ninyo. Masakit ‗yun sa amin.  We now talk about our Overseas Filipinos. They are our heroes. They and their families have sacrificed much to the --- for the country. We all know how a large part of our economic --- economy comes from their remittances. That is why to ensure that their rights are protected, I ordered the increase of our assistance to the OFW from 400 million pesos to more than 1 billion. [applause]  We have been hard at work in securing the rights and welfare of our OFWs.  A year ago, I also warned government officials and employees that I will never tolerate corruption in my administration, not even a whiff of it. Let the dismissal of several high-ranking officials --- whom I myself appointed --- serve as a warning to all that I will never back down on my commitment to cleanse this government and corporation. [applause]  In order to bring government services closer to the people, we established hotlines [and] government centers that receive public concerns, one of which is the Hotline 911, which allowed us to receive and immediately respond to emergencies.  We also launched Hot --- launched Hotline 8888, the Citizen‘s Complaint Hotline. This is a public hotline facility that receives feedbacks or concerns on government services.  Since we launched this hotline, we have received numerous complaints from the public on government --- slow government processing, unclear or changing procedures and requirements, centralized issuances of clearances and permits in Metro Manila and discourteous government employees, among others.  Ganito ‗yan. Time and again, ‗yung --- ‗yung pag-transact ng ordinaryo --- no, the ordinary people who contract business in government. In the last ASEAN Ministerial Conference, I don‘t know why Malacañang has to --- my office has to do some work for --- or the others, like itong mga barong. It‘s always the --- that outfit takes care of the attires that will be given to the ministerials, this time, to the heads of state.  Alam mo, I‘d like to address this myself to government. Iyan bang bayaran, pabalik-balikin ninyo ang tao. Alam… I know that because I‘ve been mayor for 23 years, I never allowed it in my city.But dito, alam mo ‗yang mga sastre diyan sa Parañaque hanggang Cavite --- ‗yung mga tailoring diyan --- ang negosyo lang niyan involve boy scout, teachers‘ uniform, girl scouts, naghahabol ‗yan sila ng mga kontrata.  And they are just the --- the stores that you find along the way until Cavite. They group together during times of ganito, may ASEAN. And they look for a person to represent them.  This is not --- no offense intended but --- usually, they look for beautiful women, young, who would do the talking, arrangement. You know, because it‘s the… Well, it‘s the reality of life, that the beautiful women get the attention always.  Tapos, ‗pag na-deliver na nila, nasukatan na, pabalik-balikin ninyo. And right there in Malacañan, it happened. So, I will fire the lady, whoever was connected with her, as I have fired everybody else. A Cabinet member for buying an 18-million truck in Austria. That was not our contract. It was a contract of the previous administration. Fourteen of those 18 million were already delivered.  This Cabinet member was… I was informed about and I said the legal --- his legal office --- to stop it. You know what? He went just right ahead, traveled there, signed something for the --- another tranche of delivery. So right there at the meeting --- right in the Cabinet meeting I said, ―Were you able to read the opinion of your law --- your own law office?ǁ He said, ―No.ǁ But  Sonny Dominguez was already passing to me the --- ‗yung sa iPhone. So I was reading it while I was talking to him. Sabi ko, ―P***** i** mo, you‘re fired. You‘re lying.ǁ And so I fired him, ―Go out of this office. I do not want to see your face again.ǁ Ganon ako ka-istrikto.  So ‗yung --- the Cabinet members --- and they are here --- they‘re only given, noon, one year, two years --- one month. The directors, makinig kayo sa gobyerno, bantay kayo. Directors, you‘re only given 15 days. And I do not want directors out of their office, you eat your lunch there, lahat kayong taga-gobyerno, so that you can resume to work immediately. [applause]  Now, ito ang deal ko sa public. There is the 8888. I cannot stop corruption and wrongdoings if you do not cooperate. You text me. Libre ‗yan --- 8888. You name the public official, name his sins in that bulletin, and I will take it from there. Do not be afraid about libel, I will take care of that. [applause]  Iyon ang gawain ninyo. I have to have your help. Kung hindi kasi kayo mag-ano, wala eh. Lahat. Pulis, military, lahat, pati ako. If you think that some of --- may nagawa ako na masama, sabihin ninyo. Do not be afraid.  We are all workers of government, kayo ‗yung employer namin. [applause] We get the money from your pocket to our pockets. Kami --- kailan pa… Since when have you heard me talk about government and officials? I always address everybody, ―workers of government.ǁ  I seldom mention ―Malacañan Palaceǁ. It is not a palace, it is just a house of wood. So, why should I call it a palace? Maybe something like the European-style. I just call it office. Palace, palace ka diyan eh. [laughter] And besides, all the rats of Pasig are there. [laughter]  It‘s just beside Pasig River. So ‗yung lahat ng mga daga diyan kung saan-saan, doon nagla- landing. It has a wild field, and they are not killed because they are Presidential mouse. [laughter]Iyon ang sabi ng --- iyan o sundalo. ―Sir, ‗di daw ipagbaril kay Presidential mouse.ǁ P***** i**, mabuti pa ang mouse dito kay hindi pa pinapatay, ‗yung tao kinakatay ninyo.  The people‘s patience is wearing thin, so is mine.  I am reiterating my directive to all government agencies [with] frontline services to our people -- from womb to tomb -- to further streamline their respective services to make these truly efficient and people-friendly.  We want to ensure that our people receive the quality services that they surely deserve minus the delays by the bureaucratic red tape. I expect speedy reforms along this line.  We‘ll rightsize the national government. Let us trim the excess fat and add more muscle through the expeditious passage of ―The Act Rightsizing the National Government to Improve Public Service Institute.ǁ [applause]  I therefore urge Congress to pass this at the soonest.  For the Government Owned and Controlled Corporations --- isa pa kayo --- the implementation of the existing Salary Standardization Law pending review in the Compensation and Position Classification System. Excessive, extravagant, and unconscionable salaries and allowances, incentives, benefits and bonuses across the Government Owned or Controlled Corporations at this time, in crisis.  You‘ll have to pass by my office and I am not inclined to increase your allowances, bonuses, and salaries at this time. Wala ‗yan. [applause]  You cannot do it on your own. You have to direct it to the Executive Secretary. And I‘ll just tell you, I am not inclined to give increases right now. Maybe seven years from now, when Drilon makes it to the presidency.  I also appeal to the Supreme Court to seriously consider the national interest and our development goals before issuing TROs and injunctions on critical government projects and cases involving government assets.  I am just a co-worker also, ladies and gentlemen. May I be allowed to be also just as frank? Tutal wala naman akong ina-ano, eh. I do not need to offend you.  But I cite, for example, the Supreme Court TRO that prevents the Department of Health from distributing subdermal implants, which caused a wastage of P350-million worth of taxpayers‘ money. I also note that since its issuance two years ago, this TRO has impaired the government‘s ability to fully implement responsible planning --- family planning methods in the RH Law.  It is time that we put an end to the practice of some parties of resorting to technicalities in our laws to prevent the government from fulfilling its mandate.  Ganito ‗yan, ma‘am, eh. Tutal, this is as good as any other time to talk to you. And may I be understood by you --- I am sorry to say this, really, I am --- I do not intend to do it. But if we haveto talk about government and our sins, which I am not an exception, all our --- you know --- delays, lahat naman tayo nagkakamali.  Ganito ‗yan, two things. Wala na talaga akong panahon. I‘ll just stay… I don‘t know if I can make another SONA again in the future. It‘s --- it‘s not for me to tell.  Itong TRO has been the bane of projects. And even Consunji, ‗yang mga Ayala, nag-aaway ‗yan. Just to make you understand na hindi lang kayo. Tapos, ‗yang TRO na ‗yan would delay the projects. Now God --- and I‘m asking Congress, find me a law na kung may bidding naman at it was regular, dapat ang korte or somebody else should not be messing it up.  Because it can delay the projects, which has been the case in the provinces. Alam mo, mag-file ‗yan ng kaso --- either it is really the truth and the COA will find out or makihati siya --- ―I will withdraw the case and dissolve the TRO of course. But just give me a few --- 10 percent.ǁ  Ganun ang ugali ng Pilipino. Kaya ‗yang TRO na ‗yan is the bane of our efficiency, and I really do not know whether… I will not attribute anything, ma‘am, sa Supreme Court.  Maybe I am at fault so I am sorry if I misquote or I did not have the complete facts. But itong Congress na ito passed the Reproduction Law. It was already a law na dapat i-implement because we are really going into a family planning. I am not for abortion. I am not for birth control. But certainly, I am for the giving of the freedom to a Filipino family the size ng pamilya niya. [applause]  How many children would he be able to support and send to school? Ang nangyari nitong TRO , sir, ma‘am, may nag-file doon sa inyo --- Supreme Court --- tapos nag-issue kayo ng TRO two years ago. In the meantime, ‗yung --- ang gobyerno, nagbili ng medisina --- ito subdermal pati itong mga pills worth 360. It was not really a reckless purchase. It was in preparation for the implementation of the law.  Hindi naman akalain na mag-TRO and it has been two years. The medicines will expire next month. I told Ubial, the Health Secretary, to find out if there is a nation who --- which would allow it and i-donate na lang rather than go to waste.  Iyan ho ang nangyari. I do not blame you. You might have been very busy or something. Wala. Ako, I ‗m just… I am below you, actually. Pero sinasabi ko lang. May isa pa.  Huwag na lang itong speech, walang kwenta, walang makukuha diyan. [laughter] The bane --- isa pa itong --- the Congress and tayo sa gobyerno, including the judges and justices, should understand that by this time, ‗yung lowest bid, ‗yun ang nagpo-promote ng graft and corruption sa ating bayan. [applause]  COA, you are here. Malaman na lang ninyo na may violation ako. Doon sa military, I do not allow them to bid and just to buy the weapons from everywhere, because almost all countries are making arms. Tawag nila, small arms industry. We‘re just fighting a rebellion. True, we do not need the armaments.  But diyan sa Marawi, you have to hit hard because they are prepositioned inside buildings. And until now, we cannot proceed fast because there are 300 hostages. Sabi ko, ―Do not assault. If necessary, we‘ll just have to wait. Wait it out.ǁBut we have to give food. You do not --- I do not care if they are Moro or Christians. It‘s not… We do not have that luxury. Kasi ‗pag --- there is a distinct possibility that we attack, they will just behead everybody.  So, find a way to do it. If you cannot find a way to do it then just I said, ―Wait it out.ǁ Sila ang nakatagal. Baka sabihin hindi marunong itong sundalo. Ako ‗yung pipigil. Initially, sabi ko bomba. ―Eh, sir, hindi talaga madala, sir.ǁ Every window is occupied, ‗yung high-rise. And we were losing because of the snipers. And in there, they hurry, I said, ―Slow down.ǁ  When I was --- hindi ako nagyayabang --- when I was in the camp sa Ranao, while I was briefing --- I was being briefed by the military and was giving the instructions, I heard about 16 pumutok at tsaka ‗yung bala na, ―Weng, weng, weng!ǁ Iyong mga reporter nandoon sa likod ng stage kasi semento ‗yun eh. We will ano… Sabi ko, ―If this is how we should wait, then we‘ll wait. Unless you can find a solution --- somebody here who has a good, even a horse sense to negotiate for the release of…ǁ  Ayan itong isa. Babalik ko ‗yung lowest bid. Alam mo ganun ‗yan adre eh. Ang magbabagsak ng lowest bid, ‗yung walang pera. Ang magbabagsak ng lowest bid, sasabihin niya doon sa ano, ―Magbibigay po ako sa inyo.ǁ Kung sinu-sino ‗yang mga opisyal. So, lowest bid papanaluhin siya. So, with no capital, bibigay siya ng pera. Tapos ibigay, lahat bigyan niya, connected --- lahat. Pagkatapos niyan, if it is a 100-million project, he has to pay so many guys, ang naiwan niya 100 --- out of the 100, 40 million lang, so that is the cost of the project.  So, when I was campaigning for the Presidency, I was all over the Philippines. My God, I could see a --- the appropriation, pero ang airport nila, three meters long. So ginawa na lang basketball court. [laughter]  And there is a province here. Hindi kayo, not you. If you look into the records back in time na puro na complex ang roads diyan. Talagang daan dito, daan doon. Pero ‗pag pumunta ka, isang daan lang. It‘s only one highway. That is how corruption destroys the nation.  Ngayon, last. I have to say this. Kailangan ko siya sabihin, sir, eh. I was elected June 30, nag- oath ako. So, July nagpunta na ako sa Davao --- sa AFP Medical Center. Nakwento ko na ba ito sa inyo, hindi pa? Tapos sabi ko --- it‘s quite familiar, kasi I signed a letter nung mayor ako. Sabi ko, ―May MR(I) ba kayo?ǁ Sabi nila, ―Wala, sir.ǁ Sabi ko, ―May state-of-the-art ba kayo na X- ray?ǁ Sabi, ―Wala, sir.ǁ Sabi ko, ―May hyperbaric ba kayo?ǁ That‘s the chamber where you are placed inside if you suffer the bends, ‗yung nagdi-deep dive ka. But it is also high-pressured that can arrest gangrene, especially those who are extracted from the field of battle about two days na, gangrene sets in. So, they are placed there. And it can work miracles for a wounded soldier. So, in one upuan, in one sitting, you did this…  Then, I saw the building and I went inside. Iyong drainage nila, bumabalik. So I said, ―You know, I am really surprised. You‘re military men, why would you allow that kind of…ǁ The dirt is going back to… How do you expect the sailors to --- the soldiers to get well?  Tapos, that‘s the only building. The old --- the oldest. I said, ―Okay, you rehabilitate it. I‘ll give  you a new one in the meantime.ǁ But last month I went to the back of my office, doon sa barracks ng Presidential guards. So, we were groundbreaking for the hospitals of the soldiers. And I asked the soldiers who were there also from V. Luna, ―Are you now using the equipment?ǁAlam mo ang sinagot sa akin, ―Sir, tayo-tayo na lang ang mag-usap huwag na ‗yan sila. T**** i**, wala pa. Hindi pa na-deliver.ǁ Sus.  Sinabi ko, ―If this is the way how you treat our soldiers and they are dying now and that machine was ordered a year ago, and then a coup d‘état, a mutiny is not a surprise to me.ǁ  Kaya sabi ko kay Ubial, hindi niya kasalanan it‘s because of the procurement. Pero ganun… Is Secretary Ubial here? Are you here Secretary? Change the procedure because I will change you.[laughter]  Talagang mag-coup d‘état ‗yan. Marami ng… We are losing about… By this time meron, every - -- everyday we lose about 10? Everyday. Sometimes I say it‘s a useless war. There is a rebellion. Sabi ko maski kung ako ang sundalo niyo and there is a machine already ordered it could have save my leg, tapos wala ma‘am, ay p**** i**, mag-coup d‘état ako.  And let us get the machine by ourselves. I will not be surprised if it‘s already in their minds. Ako, I am only be too willing to step down.  But as a long-term solution, I urge Congress to thoroughly review our existing procurement laws and come up with legislation that will ensure the prompt delivery of quality goods and services to the people, especially medicines and hospital equipment. [applause] Kasi itong military ang sabi ko do not mind COA about I will answer for that. Since COA is here I limit it to three places where the military can buy the equipment. Because I‘m sure that we will work and they can kill the enemies and make even our forces stronger or in parity with what they have on the other side.  Itong armas sabi ko huwag mong sundin ‗yan. I will explain to COA why. Huwag mo akong pabibilhin diyan sa mga lugar ng South America at lahat diyan sa mid-European ----- Eastern European countries are also… There are good ones but I limited them to ---- especially equipment in listening kasi kung magbili ka doon sa iba, nakikinig rin sila, sabay na kayo. Tatlo na kayong nagko-communicate. Tawag sa Bisaya, ―brin.ǁ  Our laws should support, and not impede, national development in a speedy and sustainable manner.  In our bid to accelerate human capital development, we seek to ensure lifelong opportunities by enhancing the quality of and access to education and training programs.  We have sustained investments in higher education and committed to the full implementation of the K to 12 Basic Education Program. We have widened the reach of skills training and increased the number of out-of-school children and youth who have availed of the Alternative Learning System.  To ensure that Filipinos are given equitable access to quality and affordable health services, we expanded health insurance coverage and benefits. The destitute and the indigents, or those who just could not afford hospitalization, can now be provided with free services by government- operated, public hospitals as we have strengthened the implementation of the No Balance Billing Policy. [applause] Kayong mga Pilipino na nakikinig sa akin ngayon magpa- hospital kayo ako ang magbayad tutal hindi naman nila ako mademanda. Pasok lang kayo doon occupy the hospital sabihin mo lang --- totoo ------------------------- pasok kayo ng hospital sabihin ninyo na sabi ni MayorDuterte pagamot daw kami siya daw ang bahala magbayad. [applause] Marami tayong tresurero dito. [Ah huwag na ‗yan iba naman sa taas na.]  I have signed Executive Order No. 26 imposing a ban on smoking in public places to mitigate its consequences. [applause] We want to minimize access to tobacco products, and provide a more supportive environment for those who are attempting to quit tobacco use.  Alam mo bakit? Tinamaan ako ng … ‗Di ba ito, I have been very frank with you. I have a Barrett and I have a Buerger‘s disease, caused by smoking. So ang problema niyan --- in a survey in the Philippines and all over the world, why is it that the women force --- workforce in an office and the men have acquired in equal, almost in parity in numbers sick of cancer.  And it was found out because the poor girl has also to --- inhale your smoke. Kaya [inaudible] ko sa Davao… In Davao you cannot see a person there walking with a cigarette. Foreigners, they are very --- they can argue with you, say that, ―This is my money not your money.ǁ Sabi ko, ―Then, okay. Eat your money or I will shoot your b****.ǁ [laughter]  Investing in the health sector is never a cost to be endured but an opportunity to be explored.  If we are to embrace the vision of a prosperous Philippines, we have to start putting value to our people‘s well-being – because the success of every Filipino‘s pursuit in life, liberty and happiness directly mirrors the fulfilment of our aspirations as a Filipino.  I would like to reiterate my personal and this administration‘s commitment to fully implement the Magna Carta of Women to the barangay level tapos na ito. [applause] To this effect, an executive order will be issued to local government units institutionalizing gender and development programs and services.  We are targeting to increase Government spending on infrastructure from 5 percent of GDP in 2017 to 7 percent of GDP by 2022, amounting to a total of 8 to 9 trillion pesos or 160 [applause] to 180 billion dollars in infrastructure projects. We will make the next few years the ―Golden Age of Infrastructureǁ in the Philippines to enhance our mobility and connectivity, and thereby spur equitable growth and development in the country. In other words, we are going to Build, Build and Build.  To improve our sea connectivity, we launched 15 brand new RORO vessels to ply major nautical routes all over the country. We also opened an ASEAN Ro-Ro Shipping Route connecting the ports of Davao and General Santos, Philippines to Bitung, Indonesia.  To address the congestion in our sea ports, we modernized the Ports of Iloilo, General Santos and Cagayan de Oro and Zamboanga. We shall complete strategic road and bridge projects and some of the road sections shall be widened and improved to address the worsening traffic.  Alam mo si Ma‘am Grace, you are pushing for... You know, when I became President, EDSA was already horrendous as it was a horror of the other administrations.  Now, I brought in Tugade because Tugade to me is a bright boy. He‘s a billionaire. He was my classmate. Ewan ko kung nandito siya. He was our valedictorian in the law class. Talagang mahusay.But we needed money and we tried to get your help to raise money. Ayaw naman ibigay. Eh ‗di hanggang ngayon nandiyan pa ‗yung EDSA. Okay lang, at least gumanda lahat mag-iwan naman tayo ng pangit. We will not make it all smooth in the Philippines. We leave a little alley known as EDSA as the road to perdition.  But anyway since I could not get any funding. I traveled to China and make friends with them, and the ambassador is here, Ambassador Zhao, thank you for the help. And as a matter of fact [applause] willing… He said, ―If your Congress has no money, we will give you the money.ǁ And China has committed to build two bridges to span Pasig River, free of charge. [applause] So that you will be comfortable in crossing Pasig.  Anyway, all of these strategic road and transport projects shall go to naught if we cannot free our streets, which continue to be obstructed by illegally parked vehicles, ‗yang EDSA na ‗yan traffic obstructionists or undisciplined drivers who stop in the middle of the road, and unsanctioned barriers in some areas.  I am directing the MMDA and the LGUs of Metro Manila, as well as the LGUs of Metro Cebu and of all our regional centers, to ensure the free flow of traffic, and immediately clear our roads and thoroughfares of all unnecessary obstruction, including vehicles parked on the streets and barriers --- [applause] [not] sanctioned by the Government, and penalize all traffic obstructionists regardless of stature…  Sometimes hindi mo maano diyan because the police, it‘s a Cabinet member. Pero may I have not --- authorized my Cabinet member to utilize the low plate. Is it not for us to, you just use an ordinary plate, para walang masabi ‗yung tao. I do not want you parking there when there‘s no parking. Please remove…  Airports, we are building new airports. We might get some money also from China and will have new airports in the coming days.  We are now accelerating the implementation of the Communications, Navigation, Surveillance and Air Traffic Management System project, which will result to on-time arrivals and departures, better managed air traffic, reduced flight operating costs, and safer and more convenient travel experience.  Revenues are the lifeblood of the government, which enable us to provide for the people‘s needs.  Last May 31, 2017, we achieved the first step towards more equitable taxes to fund better services for the people. I commend the House of Representatives [applause] for heeding my urgent certification of the tax reform by passing the first of five packages of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program with an overwhelming 246 votes, representing almost [90] percent of the Filipino people.  The fate of the tax reform is now in the hands of the Senate. Ano bang gustong ninyong gawain, mag-luhod ako niyan? Well, really I‘ll leave it up to you. We are all Filipinos. If you think that‘s a waste, fine. If you think it‘s not good, it‘s okay with me. I can survive.[Next] I call on the Senate to support my tax reform in full and to pass it without haste [applause]. Ayaw man magpakpak --- ah pati si ano wala, they are not clapping so. Si Angara ayaw rin mag-clap. [laughter] Bantay ka lang sa election tingnan mo. [laughter]  These reforms are designed to be pro-poor, especially when the people understand how the revenues will be spent.  The passage of the Tax Reform Law is needed to fund the proposed 2018 budget which I am submitting here and today.  The poor and vulnerable [applause] are at the heart of my tax reform. Your full support will ensure that the benefits of the tax reform can be felt immediately by them.  In the meantime, the Department of Finance and Bureau of Internal Revenue are strengthening and running after tax evaders. [applause]  I have directed the Department of Finance and the BIR to accept Mighty Corporation‘s offer of P25 billion to settle its tax liabilities. [applause] After the settlement, Mighty will no longer engage in the tobacco business.  This will be the biggest tax settlement on record. [applause] It will produce a windfall for government, which is significant, since we face the unexpected costs of rebuilding Marawi and Ormoc.  The acceptance of the tax settlement offer does not preclude other criminal charges against the company that the BIR may decide to file. A settlement will allow government to avoid a long [court] battle that, as we saw in previous cases, could take years to resolve.  Let this be a lesson to others. This administration will spare no one found cheating the government of its due.  We view Information and Communications Technology or ICT as an effective medium to implement positive and meaningful changes in our society.  To this end, my Cabinet approved the National Broadband Plan of 2017 to begin the work of bringing affordable Internet access to every community and improving broadband connectivity in the country.  We have also installed free Wi-Fi Internet in almost 400 public places around the country. [applause] We hope that the public will use them to access important information and services.  The National Government Portal, which we launched recently, will allow faster and easier delivery of public services and reduce the number of visits of the public to agencies for government transactions.  The Digital Terrestrial Television Broadcasting Migration Plan has also been launched. The switch to digital from analog transmission will not only give a better TV viewing experience but also provide effective and reliable information to Filipinos in times of calamities.The government-owned Salaam Digital TV, the first Muslim TV in the Philippines, is now already on test broadcasting. [applause]  There are some of the things we have done for the past twelve months. A more detailed narrative is contained in my Report to the People, will be released soon. Whether or not my first year of administration was a year of gains or a year of setbacks is not for me to say but for the people to judge. I defer to the people‘s judgment [applause].  My fellow citizens, much remains to be done. Corruption persists like a fishbone stuck in the throat. It pains and it is disconcerting. We need to pry corruption from the government corpus [where it] is deeply embedded. We also need to put an end to squabbles and bickerings within agencies [and] focus fully on the speedy provision of quality public services to our people.  Believe me, it is easier to build from scratch than to dismantle the rotten and rebuild upon its rubble.  Nevertheless, let us work together and lay a new foundation upon which a better Philippines can be reconstructed. Help me build a better tomorrow.  Let me end… Gusto ninyo uwi na tayo? O gusto ninyo ng kwento? Marami pa akong ikwento sa inyo.  Let me end by wishing everyone in the language of the old: ―May God keep us forever sheltered in the hollow of His hand.ǁ  Salamat. [applause]  --- END ---"

Thank you for your courtesy.  Senate President Vicente Sotto III and the members of the Senate; House Speaker Pantaleon Alvarez and the members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; Former Presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Ejercito Estrada, and Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo; His Excellency Gabriele Caccia and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the members of the Cabinet; Acting Chief Justice Antonio Carpio and the justices of the Supreme Court; my fellow workers in government; mga kababayan.  About two years ago, I solemnly took my oath as a worker of the national government. I was as inspired to institute real changes for the greater good of the Filipino people, as I was greatly overwhelmed then by the daunting challenges that lay ahead.  Two years later, my solid commitment to directly and decisively address our nation’s collective challenges remains. It has not wavered. In truth, it has even gotten stronger through adversity and the desire to give the people the most we can, within my term in this government.  Let me begin by putting it bluntly: the war against illegal drugs is far from over. Where before, the war resulted in the seizure of illegal drugs worth millions of pesos, today, they run [into] billions in peso value. I can only shudder at the harm that those drugs could have caused had they reached the streets of every province, city, municipality, barangay and community throughout the country.  This is why the illegal drugs war will not be sidelined. Instead, it will be as relentless and chilling, if you will, as on the day it began. These drug dealers know fully well that their business is against the law. They know the consequences of their criminal acts, especially when caught in flagrante delicto and they violently resist arrest. They know that illegal drugs waste away lives, dysfunctionalize families, and ruin relationships. They know that once hooked, addicts will die slowly --- slow deaths. And yet, they persist in doing what they do, oblivious to the terrible harm that they cause to the people and communities.  And when illegal drug operations turn nasty and bloody, advocates of human rights lash at—and pillory—our law enforcers and this administration to no end. Sadly, I have yet to hear really howls of protest from the human rights advocates and church leaders against drug-lordism, drug dealing and drug pushing as forceful and vociferous as the ones directed against the alleged errant [law] enforcers in the fight against this social scourge.  If you think that I can be dissuaded from continuing this fight because of [your] demonstrations, your protests, which I find, by the way, misdirected, then you got it all wrong. [applause]  Your concern is human rights, mine is human lives. [applause] The lives of our youth are being wasted and families are destroyed, and all because of the chemicals called shabu, cocaine, cannabis, and heroine.  Human rights to me means giving Filipinos, especially those at the society’s fringes, a decent and dignified future through the social and physical infrastructures necessary to better their lives.The lives and freedoms and the hard-earned property of every Filipino whose condition we wish to improve shall be protected from criminals, terrorists, corrupt officials, and traffickers [of] contrabands.  You worry  about  the  present;  I  am  concerned  [about]  both the   present   and   the  future. [applause] I worry about the future because I know what crimes can do to the youth of this country. If not stopped, crimes can make human cesspools of succeeding generations. I will not allow it to happen. Not during my term.[applause]  Time and again, I have stressed that corruption must stop. [applause] Corruption is like a leech that it bleeds the government of funds programmed for its infrastructure and other social development projects. It saps the morale or the morale of dedicated and honest government workers.  Corruption destroys those who succumb to its temptation and eventually it is the innocent who will suffer and bear its horrible consequences.  The love of money is corrosive. And sadly, the desire to make the easy kind by being imaginative and manipulative, corrupts absolutely. Stolen wealth does not make the thief respectable. Neither will the trappings of wealth mask [nor] cap the stink that thievery exudes. One day, justice will catch up with those who steal government funds. And when that day comes, it will be the public who will have its retribution.  While we run after those who steal the people’s money, we are also enhancing the government’s delivery of frontline services. I thank Congress for the swift passage of the Ease of Doing Business [Act], [applause] which is a significant fight against corruption and improving service delivery. We need to sustain our momentum. And I hereby direct all [local] government units --- makinig sana kayo --- and government agencies to faithfully implement this law and simply simplify the process. Hinihingi ko ho ‘yan sa lahat nasa gobyerno under my control and supervision. Huwag ho kayong magkamali.  I particularly call the attention of the agencies with the [most] number of red tape-related reports from the public, make your services truly customer-friendly. Our people deserve efficient, effective, and responsive government services. They deserve nothing less. [applause] Kayo lang ang ayaw eh. Gusto ng tao kayo ‘yung binabayaran, make your living from the pockets of the people, and you have a lousy and corrupt bureaucracy.I have friends and political supporters whom I appointed to public office and then dismissed or caused to resign. I need not mention their names or recount the circumstances surrounding their removal or resignation. Media has more than amply reported that.  I value friendship, make no mistake about it. But it has its limits.  This is a lonely place I am hemmed in. Do not make it lonelier by forcing me to end our friendship because you gave me the reason to end it. It pains me to end --- the loss of friendships. And that is why I appeal to you to help me in my cause so that our friendship will endure.  For as long as I can remember, the bulk of the income generated in Mindanao used to be remitted to what we, in Mindanao, refer [to] as the “Imperial Manila” to fund national projects primarily in the Metro Manila area, leaving a pittance to Mindanao as its share thereof. Mindanao was dubbed as “The Land of Promise,” and Mindanaoans say in derision that this is so because what it got from the government through the years were promises, promises and more promises.  We aim to rectify that derisive observation and, as a matter of fact, we are now in the process of fulfilling that promise through significant increases in the budget for Mindanao. At the end of my term, I hope to see the promise of Mindanao fulfilled, or at the very least, approaching fulfillment.  Be that as it may, Mindanao pauses at the crossroads of history. One road leads to harmony and peace; the other, to war and human suffering.  Despite all that has been said [for] or against the Bangsamoro Organic Law by all sectoral groups, I make this solemn commitment that this administration will never deny our Muslim brothers and sisters the basic legal tools to chart their own destiny within the Constitutional framework of our country.  When the approved version is transmitted and received by my office… The law has been passed actually and I intend to… Give me 48 hours to sign it and ratify the law. [applause] Babasahin ko pa bago ko pipirmahan. Baka may isiningit kayo diyan na hindi maganda para sa --- para sa ibang tao.  We will need loads of understanding and patience to endure and overcome the birth pangs or pains of the new beginning. To me, war is not an option. We have been through the catastrophe in Marawi. We have seen the horror, the devastation, and the human toll and the displacement of both Christians and Muslims alike.  I have made a pledge that ISIS terrorists or groups or its allies will never gain foothold in our country. Yet, when what remained of the decimated Maute-ISIS group in Marawi finally saw the error of their ways and expressed their desire to be reintegrated into society, we welcomed them with open arms and embarked on genuine efforts to embrace a peaceful, productive life for them. We owe it to our fallen soldiers and police officers in Marawi and elsewhere to put an end to the bloodshed and seek the path of true peace—a peace that will last beyond this lifetime, and whose dividends our children will reap.On international relations, we shall continue to assert and pursue an independent foreign policy. Our long-term national development and national security goals come first.  We shall continue to reach out to all nations regardless of their prevailing political persuasions or proximity to or distance from our shores so long as these nations wish us well.  Our stronger bonds with our ASEAN friends have made possible our trilateral border patrols with Indonesia and Malaysia, which has since then put out of business sea pirates, piracy and other terrorists who used to infest our shared seas. This is a testament to the readiness of our country and our good neighbors to make regional peace and security our shared responsibility.  We have successfully hosted the 50th ASEAN Anniversary and the 31st ASEAN Summit last November 2017. We have shown the world what we are capable of when we work together. The ASEAN events showcased not only the world-renowned Filipino hospitality and organizational capabilities but also our artistic talent. I would like to commend the [ASEAN National] Organizing Council led by no less than my Executive Secretary, Salvador Medialdea. [applause]  Our re-energized relations with China has also led to an unprecedented level of cooperation between our nations on the war against transnational crimes. Our shared intelligence led to the discovery and dismantling of the clandestine shabu laboratories and the arrest of Chinese chemists [connected] with the Dragon organization called Wu Syndicate.  Our improved relationship with China, however, does not mean that we will waver in our commitment to defend our interests in the West Philippine Sea.[applause] This is why we engage China through bilateral and multilateral platforms such as the ASEAN-China and the Philippines- China Bilateral Consultation Mechanism.  Opening lines of communication and amicably managing differences have led to positive developments that include renewed access of Filipino fishermen in the areas in dispute in the Philippines --- West Philippine Sea.  Participation in the ASEAN-China dialogue has also resulted to the draft framework for the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea which intends to resolve disputes by peaceful means.  We admire our Filipino migrant workers for their selflessness and courage in enduring the hardships of living away from home to provide for their families. You epitomize the innate resilience of the nation. You have shown your willingness to toil and sacrifice day-in and day-out, for the long-term good of your family and loved ones. You have also contributed greatly to the national economy, even as you help in small and big ways to the economies of our international partners.  This is why we strongly condemn the deaths and abuses experienced by Filipino migrant workers in the hands of their foreign employers. I have said this before and I say it again: I am a worker of government, and it is my vow to make sure that your well-being remains our foremost foreign policy concern. [applause]It is for this reason that we are continuing to work with the host nations to ensure the welfare of our countrymen. I appeal to all host governments to help us, as true and dependable partners, in this endeavor.  I have always believed that no matter how well-intentioned a leader is, no matter how well- conceived may be his mission, if he lacks the political will to do what needs to be done, then he can only end up a failure and a hopeless dreamer.  As a worker of government, I promised to do whatever it would take to give all Filipinos a comfortable life, fighting powerful interests and making sacrifices. My obligation is to promote and uphold the greatest good, for the greatest number. [applause]  Our campaign against Endo has resulted in the regularization of more than 300,000 workers as of early this month. On May 1 of this year, I signed Executive Order 51, which sought to protect the workers right to security of tenure.  Read my lips, I understand that this does not satisfy all sectors. I share their sentiment; I truly do. Much as I would like to do the impossible, that power is not vested upon me by the Constitution. And neither will I make both ends meet even if I violate the laws to achieve that purpose. Simply, it is not part of my territory.  That is why I add mine to their voices in asking Congress to pass legislation ending the practice of contractualization once and for all. [applause]  Our farmers, especially our coconut farmers, form a significant part of the basic sectors of society. It is from the toil of their hands that we put food on the table. It is my hope that we finally see this through. I urge you Congress to convene the [bicameral] conference committee and pass at the soonest possible time  the  bill  establishing  the  Coconut  Farmers’  Trust  Fund. [applause] I pray that you will do it.  My administration remains firm in its resolve to ensure that the country’s telecommunications services are reliable, inexpensive and secure. A draft Terms of Reference for the entry of a new, major industry player is at hand. The terms will be fair, reasonable and comprehensive. It will be inclusive so it will be open to all interested private parties, both foreign and local. The only condition is that the chosen entity must provide the best possible services at reasonably accessible prices.  However, our efforts to usher in a new major player shall be rendered futile if we do not improve its odds of success in an industry that has long been dominated by a well-entrenched duopoly.  We shall, therefore, lower interconnection rates between all industry players. Not only to lessen the cost to the consumers as it will also lower the costs [for the] incoming player to access existing networks, [thereby creating] a market environment that is more conducive to competition. This is a policy which is crucial to ensure that our solution to our telecommunication problems will be both meaningful and lasting.In the last 2 years, experience has taught me that lack of consultation or insufficiency of information can, at times, lead to rash judgments. If and when I am unsure on the most appropriate course of action to take given the problem, it’s factual milieu and the desired end, I never fail to consult to discuss options with persons whom I trust and whose advice I value.  When I decided to establish Malasakit Centers in Cebu, Tacloban and Iloilo, my long-time aide, Bong Go and his team became instrumental in arriving at the right decision through proper consultations. [applause]  Deliberations with the proper agencies also made me decide to push for, and eventually approve, both the [free] Tertiary Education Act and the increase in the salary of our men in uniform, our soldiers and our policemen. [applause]  Boracay Island, widely regarded as one of our country’s treasures and admired worldwide for its natural beauty, has sadly become the representation of the government’s negligence, including mine.  I could not allow this decay to continue; decisive action has long been overdue. Recognizing that we are mere stewards of our natural resources, and I said enough is enough.  We intend to restore its environmental integrity, alongside measures to alleviate those whose livelihood were momentarily affected. Environmental protection and ensuring the health of our people cannot be overemphasized; thus, our actions in Boracay mark the beginning of a new national effort.  This is just [the beginning]. For the other tourist destinations needing urgent rehabilitation and enforcement of environmental and other laws shall soon follow. I urge our local government units to proactively enforce our laws and not wait for us to swoop down on your areas just to do your duty and work. [applause] At some other time, I would have to discuss sa local government units.  What has happened to Boracay is just an indication of the long-overdue need to rationalize, in a holistic and sustainable manner, the utilization, management, and development of our lands. I therefore urge the Senate to urgently pass the National Land Use Act [applause] to put in place a national land use policy that will address our competing land requirements for food, housing, businesses, and environmental conservation. We need to do this now.  To help safeguard the present and the future generations, we have to earnestly undertake initiatives to reduce our vulnerabilities to natural hazards, and bolster our resilience to the impact of natural disasters and climate change.  As I had stated last year, we must learn from the experiences from the Super-typhoon Yolanda, and other mega disasters, and from global best practices. We need a truly empowered department characterized by a unity of command, science-based approach and full-time focus on natural hazards and disasters, and the wherewithal to take charge of the disaster risk reduction; preparedness and response; with better recovery and faster rehabilitation.Hence, we, in the Cabinet, have approved for immediate endorsement to Congress the passage of a law creating the “Department of Disaster Management,”[applause] an inter-agency --- just like FEMA. Well, I don’t know if it’s --- it’s an effective agency in the United’s government.  An inter-agency crafted and a high-priority measure aimed at genuinely strengthening our country’s capacity for [resilience] to natural disasters. I fervently appeal to Congress to pass this bill with utmost urgency. Our people’s safety requirements cannot wait.  Ours is a rich and beautiful country, indeed. Add to that a great number of people equipped with technical expertise and professionalism, and you have a country poised to soar and take its place among the world’s economic and financial eagles. God willing. Inshallah.  Nature endowed us with this wealth to be tapped for the benefit of all generations. My policy in the utilization of these resources is non-negotiable: the protection of the environment must be top priority [applause] and extracted resources must be used for the benefit of the Filipino people, [applause] not just a select few. Do not just give me taxes. I can get it from other sources. Give me what needs to be given to my countrymen. [applause]  To the mining industry, I say this once again and maybe for the last time, do not destroy the environment or compromise our resources; repair what you have mismanaged. Try to change [your] management radically because this time you will have restrictive policies. The prohibition of open pit mining is one. [applause]It is destroying my country. It is destroying the environment. It will destroy the world of tomorrow for our children. [applause]  Again, I warn irresponsible miners, along with their patrons, to stop destroying our watersheds, recharge areas, forests, and aquatic resources. You can no longer fish in our rivers. It’s all contaminated. And the color is not even brown or white, it’s black. You want to see it? I will invite you. We can go to Diwalwal and the other mining areas. And I’m sure you will puke with what is happening to this country. Expect reforms, radical ones. I do not intend to quarrel with anybody, with the moneyed, but for as long as I am here I said: you will just have to contend with me.  I expect you to do your part in ensuring our nation’s sustainable development, starting now.  I exhort all concerned agencies and local government units to uphold the concept of inter- generational responsibility in [the exploration] and utilization of our mineral wealth, the protection and preservation of our biodiversity, anchored on the right to a balanced and healthy ecology.  I applaud Congress for the timely passage of the TRAIN law. You have made funds available to build better roads and bridges, and improve health and education, and strengthen our safety and security. Some have incorrectly blamed our efforts toward a fairer tax system for all the price increases in the past months, and some irresponsibly suggesting to stop TRAIN’s implementation. We cannot and should not. We need this for sustainable growth that leaves no Filipino left behind.TRAIN is already helping poor families and senior citizens cope up with rising prices. We have distributed unconditional cash transfers to 4 million people, and we will help 6 million more this year.  Following the one-peso discount per liter in gas stations, we have also started releasing fuel vouchers to public utility jeeps and other valid franchises. Further, we have fast-tracked the distribution of NFA rice to provide affordable rice for all. [Excuse me.]  This year, we are giving 149 billion pesos worth of subsidies to the poor and vulnerable. Next year, the amount will be increased to 169 billion pesos.  But no amount of subsidy can help the poor if some businesses take advantage of the situation to make more money. I ask businesses to cooperate with us in charging a fair price.  To help stabilize rice prices, we also need to address the issue of artificial rice shortage. I now ask all the rice hoarders, cartels and their protectors, you know that I know who you are: stop messing with the people. I hate to… Power sometimes is not a good thing. But I hope I will not have to use it against you.  Consider yourselves warned; mend your ways now or the full force of the State shall be brought to bear upon you. I am directing all intelligence agencies to unmask the perpetrators of this economic sabotage and our law enforcement agencies to bring them to justice.  We are also working on long-term solutions. On top of this agenda to lower the price of rice. We need to switch from the current quota system in importing rice to a tariff system where rice can be imported more freely. This will give us additional resources for our farmers, reduce the price of rice by up to 7 pesos per kilo, and lower inflation significantly. I ask Congress to prioritize this crucial reform, which I have certified as urgent today.  Alam mo, ako humihingi talaga ng tulong. Business is really for profit I understand that. But the Philippines has always been a playground for, you know, scoundrels and those who do it without really considering the plight of the others. It’s all conscience.  When I ran for public office, I promised to do whatever it takes to give all Filipinos a comfortable life, even if it means fighting powerful interests. I am committed to a comprehensive tax reform, and I ask Congress to continue the job.  Package 2 will lower corporate income taxes, especially for our small businesses. Lower taxes mean they will have more money to invest and create more jobs. More than 99 percent of our businesses are micro, small, or medium enterprises (MSME) and employ around 65 percent of our workers. The enactment of the Package 2 is what stands between today and millions of jobs in the near future.  Congressmen Cua, Gonzales, Abu, and Garin and Batocabe, as well as the Suansing family, filed versions of Package 2 last March 2018. Salamat po [applause] and I support their push to shepherd the bill. I hope the Senate will follow suit, maybe tomorrow, sir.This matter is urgent. Do not be part of the problem by ignoring it. I hope to sign Package 2 before the year ends. I urge Congress to pass it  in  a  form  that  satisfies  our  goals  and serves [applause] the interests of the many, not just the wealthy few.  By the end of July 2018, all 5 packages of my tax reform would have been submitted to Congress. Apart from TRAIN, rice tariffication, and Package 2, they include the mining, alcohol, and tobacco tax increase, reform in property valuation, reform in capital income and financial taxes, and an amnesty program.  I urge Congress to take them seriously and pass them in succession, for there is no chance that we can deliver our promises without an equitable tax system.  One of the most important thrusts of this administration's medium-term development plan is to cover all Filipinos against financial health risks. That is why I have directed concerned agencies to streamline the various sources of financial assistance for people with health-related needs.  We are currently institutionalizing the unified implementation of  the  ""No  Balance  Billing  Policy"" [applause] through which the government and our private healthcare providers can work out a system that will provide an order of charging of medical expenses.  Much needs to be done to improve our healthcare system, which remains highly fragmented, resulting in disparity in health outcomes between the rich and the poor in the urban areas and rural. While investments in health have increased over the years, several policy and operational bottlenecks have constrained universal health care for this country.  We shall pool all our resources for health services under the [PhilHealth]; institutionalize primary care as a prerequisite to access higher level of healthcare; and supplement human resource gaps of the LGUs through a National Health Workforce Support System.  These will ensure that every Filipino [family] gets the appropriate, affordable, and quality health services in appropriate facilities and will be protected from financial burden due to sickness.  To this end, I urge the speedy passage of the Universal Health Care Bill authored by Former Representative Harry Roque. [applause] Strong political determination, not political ambition, is the guiding light. [applause]  I have no illusions of occupying this office one day longer than what the Constitution under which I was elected permits; or under whatever Constitution there might be.  Four administrations before me have tried to amend the Constitution to be able to introduce amendments and reservations to the charter --- revisions rather to the charter. But none of them has successfully done for one reason or another.I therefore consider it a distinct honor and privilege to have received earlier from the Consultative Committee that I created, the draft Federal Constitution that will truly embody the ideals and aspirations of all the Filipino people. [applause]  I thank all the members of the Committee, especially those who came out from their retirement, for their valuable services in crafting this draft Federal Constitution. I would like to extend my particular gratitude to Former Chief Justice Reynato Puno [applause] and Former Senate President Aquilino Pimentel, Jr.[applause]  I am confident that the Filipino people will stand behind us as we introduce this new fundamental law that will not only strengthen our democratic institutions, but will also create an environment where every Filipino—regardless of social status, religion, or ideology—will have an equal opportunity to grow and create a future that he or she can proudly bequeath to the succeeding generations.  My countrymen, I will not bore you with a litany of this administration’s projects completed otherwise in the process. That would be too self-serving. I have instead caused to be prepared a written report on what has --- what was and what has been done in the months and probably in the years to come. The reports shall be made available within the next few days.  I was informed that satellite facilities were set up by the Presidential Communications Operations Office in certain far flung barangays so as of today the residents of these communities can watch the State of the Nation and for the first time see you on TV. I hope you have enjoyed the experience. [applause]  In ending, may I quote --- I have always quoted but --- in my previous talks. One American that I salute, the great Abraham Lincoln. And this has been --- I’ve been in government for the last… If I completed my… If I complete my term, Inshallah, God willing, I would have served government for 40 years.  And I came across this statement which has been with me since I was a fiscal in the 70s. And he said: If I were to try to read, much less answer, all the attacks made on me, this shop, the presidency, might as well be closed for any other business. I do the very best I know how—the very best I can; and I mean to keep doing so until the end. If the end brings me out all right, what is --- what has been said against me won’t amount to anything. But if the end brings me out wrong, ten angels of God swearing that I was right would make no difference.  Daghang salamat ka ninyong tanan. [applause]    --- END ---"

Kindly sit down. Kumusta po kayo?  Senate President Vicente Sotto III and the honorable members of the Senate; House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and the honorable members of the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo, magandang hapon po sa inyo --- sa iyo, ma’am, [applause] kung nasaan ka; former Presidents Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Ejercito, [applause] Macapagal- Arroyo [applause]; His Excellency Caccia and the esteemed members of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the other members of the Cabinet; Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin and the Supreme Court; my fellow workers in government; mga mahal kong kababayan.  Let me begin by extending my hand in gratitude to all who kept faith with me in our most trying times. Numbers speak a thousand words and tell a hundred tales. But the landslide victory of the Administration candidates as well as the latest survey results shows that my disapproval rating is 3%. [applause] I hope that the members of Congress --- sana hindi kayo included sa 3% [laughter] --- inspires me with determination to pursue relentlessly what we have started at the start of my administration.  Few men imbued with the will and the courage to do what he believes is right and just and whatever be the opposition in terms of numbers and noise, makes a majority. For it is not the eagle in the fight but the fight in the eagle that matters. [applause] Believe me, I will end my term fighting.  It has been three years since I took my oath of office, and it pains me to say that we have not learned our lesson. The illegal drug problem persists. Corruption continues and emasculates the courage we need to sustain our moral recovery initiatives.  Years ago, we saw the terrible devastation caused by illegal drugs. On May 23, 2017, our law enforcers launched an operation to serve a warrant and to neutralize terrorists. A group of armed men with sophisticated weaponry and aided by locals radicalized by extremist dogma and teachings fought our troops for weeks. During that Marawi Siege, tons of shabu worth millions and millions of pesos. Drug money killed 175 and wounded [2,101] of my soldiers and policemen in that five-month battle.I am aware that we still have a long way to go in our fight against this social menace. Let the reason why I advocate the imposition of the death penalty for crimes related to illegal drugs. Our citizens have begun to do their part in the war against drugs, and through the barangay formation of anti-drug councils, and also actually surrendering bricks of cocaine found floating in the sea into our islands. I call this responsibility. However, the drugs will not be crushed unless we continue to eliminate corruption that allows this social monster to survive.  I respectfully request Congress to reinstate the death penalty for heinous crimes [applause] related to drugs, as well as plunder.  My countrymen, it is a sad commentary that we cannot distinguish our need from our greed, our principles from our prejudices, the real from the fake, and the truth from a lie. The reason is because that many of us, what matters above all is the “self.” It is selfishness [at] its worst for no purpose other than personal aggrandizement.  To borrow the language of F. Sionil Jose, we have not risen above and beyond the parochial interests. Our warped loyalty to family, friends and tribal kin continue to exact a heavy toll on our programs designed to uplift the poor and reassure our investors, our foreign investors local, and the business sector in this country.  The recent uncovering of the massive fraud perpetrated against the public health insurance system proves that corruption is pervasive. Huge amounts of medical funds were released to cover padded medical claims and imaginary treatment of ghost patients. I am grossly disappointed. The government is conned of millions of pesos which could be used to treat illnesses and possibly save the lives of many. Thus I ordered the NBI to arrest and cause the prosecution of those liable. I appointed a new PhilHealth President, whom I know is a man of integrity, a military man, a former military officer, and gave him marching orders to prioritize ridding the agency of corruption.By the way, I commend the Bureau of Investigation for its handling of high profile cases resulting in the arrest and prosecution of criminals. These culprits will have their day of reckoning in court. I hope it happens during the last three years of my term.  Concerning the unscrupulous persons manning our ports and scalawags in uniform, we have been unyielding in our reforms to weed them out of public service.  I have fired or caused the resignation of more than a hundred officials and appointees of government without regard to relationship, friendship and alliance. There is no sacred cow, as the saying goes, in my Administration.  Institutions that are the stewards of our resources and agents of development have long been a major source of public frustration. Drastic reforms within these agencies have yielded results. Our government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs), infamous for high salaries and bonuses being paid their executives and employees, have started to shape up. As of July 9, 2019, we collected more than P61 billion from GOCCs or government corporations, 32% of which, or P16 billion, from PAGCOR. [applause] This is more than the P36 billion collected in 2017. My salute to Andrea Domingo. [applause] Magpasugal ka pa, ma’am, nang marami. [laughter] Bureau of Customs, though corruption-ridden, managed to collect Five Hundred Eighty Five Billion Pesos (P585,000,000,000) in 2018. Imagine how much more could have been collected had the BOC been clean and less corrupt.  May I cut and just --- magsalita lang ako kung anong sa isip ko. I went to the Bureau of Customs two weeks ago and found out that there were about 63 of them facing charges, criminal charges, and 61 of them under investigation. I hope that I can have the cooperation of Congress if we cannot abolish their position. And if I cannot dismiss them for the reason that there is a security of tenure, I will just allow them to have their plantilla positions but they have to report to Congress everyday to help me in the huge paperwork that we have to do everyday. All of them will go out from the premises of the Customs area. [applause] I do not want them back.  We, in government, talk too much, act too little, and too slow. I recall saying that before the Congressional hearing when I was Mayor of Davao City. I say that again to emphasize how little we have changed since then. We are long on rhetorics but short on accomplishments. It’s either you Congress or --- even the Executive department and maybe me. So I am here to rectify my own error.That is why, I implore those who occupy positions of power and authority, to let your deeds and accomplishments do the talking. Lead by example. Words ring hollow when not followed by positive and prioritized action.  Time and again, I have emphasized that like my fellow workers in government, trabahante lang po ako ng Pilipino.  Last year, I assign --- I signed the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act, a significant piece of legislation to improve service delivery and fight corruption, still until now.  However, much [has] to be done in ensuring our responsiveness to the people’s needs. Based on complaints received by the Contact Center [ng] Bayan, Contact Center [ng] Bayan --- that’s in my office --- the LTO, SSS, BIR, LRA, and PAG-IBIG are the top five agencies that need to drastically improve their service.  I reiterate my government --- my directive to the government and instrumentalities, including the LGUs and the government corporations: simplify. May I… Nandito ba kayo? Simplify. Just like the others. You can do it electronically. You do not have to go to the office.  I’ve been asking that from you since three years ago. ‘Pag hindi pa ninyo nagawa ‘yan ngayon, papatayin ko talaga kayo. [applause] Nabubwisit na…  Simplify and make your services responsive to --- client-friendly. Your client is the Filipino, our employer --- from where the money in our pockets come from, from our salaries.  Thanks to Executive Secretary Medialdea, we have increased the number of lines [for] Hotline 8888 to make it more responsive to the public. Our ultimate goal is for our people to be freed from using these hotlines because government service and response have markedly improved.  Again, I will… Ang problema kasi ng Fili --- I’m addressing now to the Filipino. Kayo rin kasi sinasabi ko na sa inyo, be assertive. At ‘pag kayo o ikaw hiningian more than the required payment by government at humingi pa sa iyo, I’ve been telling you mag-eskandalo kayo sa opisina. Make a scene. Sampalin mo ‘yang p***** i** na ‘yan. [laughter] Kasi aabot rin sa akin ‘yan. [applause]And I have done that. Ako mag-prangka ako sa inyo, ako lang ang Presidente na hanggang ngayon nagbubugbog talaga ng tao diyan sa loob ng Malacañan.  Pinapakain ko ng pera ‘yang mga y*** na ‘yan. Eh galit na ako sa inyo eh. Kindly be assertive. Pagka hiningian ka, sabihin mo, “T*** *** mo. Sabi ni Duterte, the President told us, that if you extort money from me, I will slap you.”  At sampalin talaga ninyo. Hindi na bale magkaaway. I will defend you. At kung maaari and this is what I’ve been doing all along. There’s an [8888]. Be sure that it is true. Though you are not liable for libel pero huwag naman ‘yang makasakit ka ng kapwa-tao na wala namang kasalanan. [8888], then place “To President Duterte, re: abuses by the director asking for money.” Text mo, lalabas ‘yan diyan. And that is for the public to view.  At kung totoo, Malacañan, I said, is open 24 hours --- 24 hours basta corruption. And that is why that fiasco about the frigate ni Trillanes was because ‘yung Koreano na napagbili ng barko, who sold the ship to the Philippine government, wala pa hong delivery. And it was there already ready.  And that is why that Korean went to Malacañan just to complain why is it that there is no request for delivery. So I told Bong, “Bong, ayusin mo ‘yan.” He went to Lorenzana and Lorenzana nagsulat siya. May nakakuha because sa Malacañan, every administration may tao ‘yan diyan. Every administration leaves some of the men because they are appointed on plantilla position.  Eh kinuha nila then it was brought here, before the Congress. And so Bong was called to testify. And he said, he was assured it will be a closed-door. I told Bong, “No, ask for an open and public hearing.”  Sabi ko, “Sabihin mo sa lahat --- wala --- you have nothing. Just say the truth.” Sabi ko, pagkatapos niya testify, sabi ko, “Bong, maniwala ka hindi, you will be a senator.” [applause] Totoo ‘yan. That is the story of how convoluted politics and corruption here in our country works.  Equipped with political will, the government ordered the closure of Boracay Island for six months to prevent its further deterioration. We cleaned and rehabilitated the island and I allowed it to heal naturally. I am proud to say that it has been restored close to its original pristine state. Boracay Inter- Agency Task Force led by Secretary Cimatu, and fully supported by Secretaries Año, Romulo-Puyat --- Oh what’s her name? Puro surname ito,Romulo-Puyat. What’s her name? Ah si --- ah Berna. Ah, Berna Romulo-Puyat, Bello and Villar, and then TESDA Chief Mamondiong for this huge success. Kudos are also due to the PMS for integrating the six-month Rehabilitation Plan, and the NEDA for the recently-approved [Medium]-term Boracay Action Plan. [applause]  Boracay Island is just the beginning. And the girls there, the foreigners are waiting for you gentlemen to visit the place. They are all on the beach sunbathing. You are invited to --- I have not been there.  Alam mo, nung naayos ‘yan, day before we were told that there’s gonna be an opening tomorrow. So on the TV on that day, Magandang Hapon, showed a lot of buntings and banners, “Salamat Duterte.” So when I saw it, I called the military and the police, “Remove the buntings. I am not going there.” No need to really arbi --- ah advertise. I am paid for what I’m doing. Nakokornihan ako. Too much adulation, bordering pretentions. I can always smell it a mile away.  And I never went there until now. What I did was I went to the other side of the island and asked the DAR, “What is the status of the land behind the beach of Boracay?” And they are still categorized as forestal and agriculture. “Not…” I said, “Not commercial?” “No, sir.”  So I told the Agrarian Reform, “Go to the place, have it inspected because I will declare the whole of the island a land reform program.” And I gave the islands piece by piece to the Atis, the natives of the place para walang masabi. Marami kasi ginawa ko raw [applause] para linisan ko, ibigay ko sa mga kaibigan ko.  Wala akong kaibigang mayaman. Ayaw kong kaibigan ng mayaman because pagka mayaman ka, tatabi ka lang sa akin, pati ako napahiran na ng kung ano-ano ang hingiin mo sa gobyerno.  There are those who violate environmental rules. I am giving due notice to the LGUs and other stakeholders, kayo po, of tourist destinations to take extra steps in the enforcement of our laws and the protection of our environment.  On January 27, 2019, we officially started the Manila Bay rehabilitation. Though we have a long way to go, we are encouraged by the test results of the waters near Padre Faura. We will relocate informal settlers --- I hope it can happen during my time --- along the waterways and shut down establishments that continue to pollute and poison our waters.Make a choice. I’m going to the… [Malaki ba ‘yung building diyan?] I’m going to dismantle your burning --- ah building --- or just simply burn it down so that we can have a new set-up of environmental friendly, whatever that means.  Through the Build, Build, Build Program in emerging economic hubs outside Metro Manila. This will swiftly gain ground, thanks to the efforts of the Economic Team led by Secretary Dominguez. Hard at work in the interconnection of our islands and cities by air, land, and sea are Secretaries Tugade and Villar.  Alam naman ninyo. Magaganda na ang airport ninyo. Inuna ko nga kayo eh. Everybody’s complaining about the Davao airport and I said, “Davao will be the last.” Kung hindi na maabutan, sabi ko mga taga-Davao, pasensya na kayo. Para walang masabi ang Congress sa atin, baka nga 3% sila doon sa kabila.  We also paved the way for the entry of third telecommunications provider. Do not worry about this. There is no corruption at all. I guarantee you, upon the grave of my father. I do not allow --- I do not talk to them. I just say: Just do your work. And kung maaari, according to what the specifications are required by this government.  I challenge this new player to fulfill its commitment to provide fast and reliable telecommunication services to our people, especially in the underserved areas. DICT Secretary Honasan will be the lead man in this endeavor. I hope he is here. [applause]  However, developmental gains will not be felt by our people in the countryside if we cannot maintain law and order. ‘Yang peace and security, wala ‘yan. We need to enforce the law.  After almost two decades of peace negotiation, the Bangsamoro Organic Law was finally passed and ratified.  For decades, our Muslim brothers in the ARMM have been mired in poverty. My late Muslim brother, MinDA Chair Abdul Khayr Alonto, envisioned a progressive, peaceful, and united Mindanao during our lifetime. It is my hope that the Bangsamoro Transition will fast-track the establishment of regional government that will secure and comfortable life for Muslim brothers and sisters, and all indigenous communities in the Bangsamoro Regions.Additionally, I have taken the helm of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict and have assigned a Cabinet member to each region to harmonize government efforts in attaining national development [and] security.  Through the exceptional leadership of Secretary Briones and the DepEd, I am proud to say that this year more Filipino learners are receiving basic education, with over 27 million enrollees from Kinder to Senior High School. [applause]  And because we have still a little to spare, the fastest population growth, one of the --- is the Philippines. We are so industrious that we are producing more people than… [laughter] I do not want to quarrel with the religious but…  More than [823,000] --- sorry my eyes is not good --- for the… Isinusuot ko lang ‘to ‘pag mag --- paminsan-minsan eh. Out-of-school youth and adult learners were able to access non-formal education through the Alternative Learning System. For our national sports development, I support the proposed measure to create the National Academy of Sports for High School students. [applause]  Almost 86,000 micro, small, and medium enterprises or the MSMEs have received over P3 billion worth of loans since 2017, thanks to the efforts of Secretary Lopez and the DTI.  Additional benefits for solo parents, [applause] the assignment of health workers in all barangays, and the expansion of the Malasakit Centers, are what we also hope to achieve through the bills filed by the original concept of Bong Go. [applause] Para manalo sa kampanya, ‘yon ang mantra niya. Totohanin mo lang, Bong, mapahiya tayong lahat. [laughter]  I also implore Congress… You --- look. You have to study this very carefully. Congress has to postpone the May 2020 elections and ‘yung Barangay, Sangguniang Kabataan to October 2022. Because if you read it, this… [applause] To rectify the truncated terms. Paiba-iba na eh. The truncated terms of sitting barangays but also provide them with the ample time to finish their programs and projects. I suggest Congress should also enact the Magna Carta for Barangays. [applause]This Administration’s malasakit at serbisyo program has, of course, reached the Filipinos who labor in foreign lands. The milestone signing of the Bilateral Labor Agreement with Kuwait in 2018 is a testament of my commitment to stop abuses inflicted on our overseas Filipinos. To ensure their welfare, protection and their access to government services, the establishment of the Department of Overseas Filipinos will sufficiently address this particular need. [applause]  Our accomplishments for the past three years and the plans for the next three are discussed in detail in my mid-term report to the people, copies of which shall be made available before the day ends.  Let me repeat what I said many times before. Honestly, I have identified the enemy who dumped us into this quagmire we are in. I have met the enemy face-to-face and sadly, the enemy is “us.” We are our own tormentors --- addressing the Filipino people --- we are our own demons; we are as rapacious predators preying on the helpless, the weak and the voiceless. We find corruption everywhere in government with every malefactor watching his cohort’s back in blatant disregard of his oath when he assumed public office. Even the language has evolved to soften the wickedness of the criminal act. “For the Boys”, “sponsoring an event” or what-else-have-you. No amount of euphemism can trivialize or normalize betrayal of public trust or any other criminal offense. It is an injury laced with insult. It is both a national embarrassment and a national shame.  For every transaction, a commission; for every action, extortion; and a request that goes on and on – endlessly and shamelessly.  Catharsis is what we, individually and collectively, need to do today – not tomorrow but today. Self-purgation followed by the resolve to do what is right and proper, is good for the nation’s health.  Let me ask you: When will corruption end? Kailan ba talaga ‘to? Hanggang kailan? Well, I don’t know. I’ve been in --- with government for almost 35 years now. I am not singling out myself. It’s the entire gamut of our system.  Corruption exasperates. It frustrates. It is also exasperating that there are times when I think that perhaps it is blood that we need to cleanse and rinse away the dirt and the muck that stick to the flesh like leeches.  Of course, it is only a thought. I am simply thinking aloud. To dispel any controversy that my statements in this regard will create something else. Words of Pedro Guerrero who said, “Sometimes they write what I say and they write --- and they write what I say and not what I mean.” So ‘yung mga pa-purga-purga lang diyan. I use similes, metaphors, hyperbole, and other figures of speech every now and then, to prove or stress a point. I am as human as anybody else.On the matter of the Philippine --- West Philippine Sea. The avoidance of conflict --- armed conflict and protection of our territorial waters and natural resources compel us to perform a delicate balancing act. A shooting war is grief and misery multiplier. War leaves widows and orphans in its wake. I am not ready or inclined to accept the occurrence of more destruction, more widows and more orphans, should war, even on a limited scale, breaks out. More and better results can be reached in the privacy of a conference room than in a squabble in public. That is why I will do in the peaceful way, mindful of the fact that it is our national pride and territorial integrity that are at stake.  Short of expressly advocating a call to arms, there are those who say that we should stand up and stop those who fish in our economic zone. Of course we will do in due time. There is…  Alam mo ganito ‘yan eh. Noong --- when I became President and when the M16 rifles were cancelled by America upon the prodding of the US Congress, I found myself in a quandary because reports were already very ripe na there was the passing of arms in Marawi.  And because of the arms were already --- mostly in the hands of the police, hands-me-down from the army were quite old and sometimes the bolt that pushes the bullet flies out and the barrel has really become lose, and there are no more launch and planes to push it into a circular trajectory to maintain its accuracy.  So I was forced to go to China. Eh mabuti’t na lang nasabi ko sa inyo ‘to. Then in China, we had a bilateral. I brought along the military man --- Año, the chief of staff then, and all of them, Lorenzana, Esperon, National Security.  In that meeting, I said --- Cabinet members were there --- “I want to go to my territory to dig oil.” That was the word, “I dig.” Because that is ours. Ang sabi ni President Xi, “Well, you know there is a conflict there. Do you think, rather than go there and have a confrontation --- not necessarily the grey ships, war ships. But you know a squabble there could lead to something else.” Sabi niya, we just became friends. And perhaps we can talk about this. But not an outright precipitate move because… He said it softly, “It can mean trouble.”If the trouble comes out from the mouth of a president of a republic, anong magawa ko? So what did I answer? “Well then maybe, sir, we can talk about this at some other time.” But definitely, before I go, we must talk about the West Philippine Sea. We cannot you know, have our cake and eat it too.  You know, I cannot go there even to bring the Coast Guard to drive them away. China also claims the property and he is in possession. ‘Yan ang problema. Sila ‘yung in possession and claiming all the resources there as an owner. We are claiming the same but we are not in the position because of that fiasco noong dalawang nag-standoff doon during the time of my predecessor si Albert, ambassador. If I’m correct. I do not know his real name. Tayo ang umatras. Pagsabi niya umatras, that was a kind of a compromise. Tayo ang umatras. Noong umatras tayo, pumasok sila. Marami na.  That day, we lost the Spratly and the Panganiban Island. Iyan ang totoo. Walang bolahan 'yan. Ngayon, may arbitral ruling. I... I said, I could not even ask for the oil claiming the entire resources of the...  Anong sabihin ko sa kanila? Kaya sinabi ko, ""Let us do this mutually."" Of course, when Xi says, ""I will fish,"" who can prevent him? And sabi ko naman, ""We will fish because we claim it.""  And sabi ko, ""Please allow because..."" Before that, they were driving away our fishermen. 'Di ba inaabog nila? Kaya sabi ko, ""Do not drive them away because the Filipinos are of the belief that they are also --- they claim it.""  Now, if you deprive --- deprive the Filipinos of --- there, magkagulo talaga 'yan. And it could lead to ano --- not really war, and I said, ""we have to...""  Kaya ang sabi ko... When I said, “I allowed,” that was on the premise that I own the property. Pero hindi tayo in control of the property. Ayan magsabi sila, ""Of course, I will allow you."" Kaya pinabalik.  Eh 'yung disgrasya, 'yung pagsabi ""a mere incident --- legal, marine incident,"" ‘yan ang ginagamit sa batas ‘yan, ""a marine incident happened."" Hindi naman sinasabi na ""marine accident.""It was just nabanggan, wala naman. So they wanted to talk, tapos ayaw dito. And so, ""So sige, we will investigate and you investigate, and when you are ready, we should meet and compare notes, and let us determine who pays for what damage.""  Ganun lang. Ipadala ko 'yung marines ko to drive away the Chinese fishermen. I guarantee you, not one of them will come home alive.  Kung ipadala ko 'yung limang --- pati 'yung frigate ko na bago, 'yung pinagkaguluhan nila ni Trillanes diyan sa --- that made Bong a Senator, ubos 'yan because there are already guided missiles in that island.  And the fastest that they have installed there can reach Manila in seven minutes. You want war? Alam mo, asaran 'yan eh. Supladuhan 'yan. Kung supladuhan lang, murahin, ""P***** i** mo, l**** ka. Umalis ka diyan.""  Kung ganunan lang, bright ako diyan. Hanggang bunganga lang. Pero kung bunutan na ng baril, ah pwede siguro basta dalawa lang. But the problem is, there --- whether we do it in a diplomatic way, there will be heated arguments, sigurado 'yan.  We do it in a confrontation doon. We try to drive them away, it could lead to a violence. Any way 'yan. By the way the President answered when I said ""I will dig my oil"" the first time I went to China.  Nakita ko 'yung tao eh. So you can, more or less, draw a profile of his, ""Please do not do that because there will be trouble."" Ano... Anong magagawa ko?  I go there, I said, ""The fisheries who were..."" And besides, I was invoking 'yung traditional fishing rights. It is in that arbitral ruling. Ayaw lang ninyong gustong tignan.  It is mentioned there that even before countries were in existence, people around an ocean or a lake had already been fishing there for generations. And that is why fishing rights are allowed in the so many cases between Finland and Germany, decided by UNCLOS --- UNCLOS and the International Law of the Seas.  UNCLOS is a product of a treaty. That treaty is also a part of our land because we are a signatory. Eh kung basahin lang ninyo 'yan nang husto, it is there. You might just…China and everybody recognizes traditional fishing rights for the natives who were there even before the creation of republics and governments. That law is a humane law.  So I'm sorry I have to... I promised you 40 minutes. My God, I... You want me to stop? We can go home now. [laughter] I have exceeded my... There is the, you know, there is a time for everything.  Do not believe the others because they are not my friends. They are my political enemies. They said I do not believe in God. Who says? I am a believer of a universal mind there.  But [applause] I do not believe that a God so perfect would create hell for his creation. What kind of God is he? He is not my God. There is a time to --- for everything. A time to negotiate and a time to quarrel with your enemy, with your political opponents or with your wife.  That is why some lives here are... And a time to antagonize and a time to make peace and a time to go to war, and a time to live and a time to die. That's Ecclesiastes 3.  Our ownership of the Philippine --- West Philippine Sea is internationally recognized. However, both the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Arbitral Award in the case of People --- “Republic of the Philippines vs. People’s Republic of China” recognize instances where another state may utilize the resources found within the coastal state’s Exclusive Economic Zone.  The arbitral ruling even states, the one that they are charging me for violating the Constitution.... Sino gani 'yon? Suntukin lang kita diyan ngayon mabuti pa. Nandito eh. The arbitral ruling even states that the Philippines may enter into fishing agreements with other states, provided certain conditions and requisites in the UNCLOS are met.  So 'yung akin, sabi niya, ""Let's go fish."" Sabi ko, ""You have to act..."" You know, they have been there fishing since time immemorial. I think it was Adam who got the first Lapu-Lapu there.  Let me assure you, that national honor and territorial integrity shall not --- shall be foremost in our mind, and when we may take the next steps in thissmoldering controversy over the lines of arbitral ruling, the West Philippine Sea is ours.  There is no ifs and buts. It is ours. But we have been acting, [applause] along that legal truth and line. But we have to temper it with the times and the realities that we face today.  Poverty incidence fell from 27.6 percent in the first half of 2015 to 21 percent in the first half of 2018. The most important number, though, is the six million Filipinos we need to pull out from poverty. Kindly help me on this. [applause]  And you know, as I said, corruption is everywhere. You are free to investigate. I don't take offense. If there is anything wrong in my department, the Executive, you are free to open the investigation anytime.  You do not have to call me. Call the idiots, expose them, and send them to jail. You are helping me. Do not be... I am not... I've been a prosecutor. I know how it works. Feel free. Feel free to expose anything that is not in accordance with law.  We have pursued tax reforms to fund our poverty reduction programs. I therefore implore Congress to immediately pass Package 2 of the Comprehensive Tax Reform Program, or the TRABAHO Bill, which shall gradually lower the income --- corporate income tax, and rationalize and improve fiscal incentives.  It will energize our MSMEs and encourage them to expand their business and hopefully generate, hopefully --- I'm missing the word hopefully para sabihin na ""you're all talk"" --- hopefully [1.4] million jobs in the coming years. The MSMC --- MSMEs hold the promise of raising a lot of the Filipinos.  I therefore believe that it is now time for Congress to approve a new version of the Salary Standardization Law. Ngayon na. [applause] And to the teachers, alam mo dito who toil and work tirelessly to educate our young.  Kasali na po dito 'yung hinihingi ninyo. Hindi naman masyadong malaki, pero it will tide you over during these hard times. A little  bit  bigger  than  before. [applause] This is intended to increase the salaries of national government  workers,  including   teachers   and   nurses.   Nurses,   correct. [applause]I am also asking Congress to pass the remaining packages of my Administration’s Tax Reform Program, and the bills that would further raise excise taxes on --- very good, let us do it --- tobacco and alcohol.  Sinong naninigarilyo dito? They should be exterminated from the face of the earth. [laughter] They are the ones... You know, I... I'm... I do not hide my - -- what's wrong with me. I acquired Buerger's disease because I smoke.  But I made it a national policy because you know when I was new mayor, I went around to see the discos and night clubs. I could hardly see the faces of the people inside. You have to wade into a thick smoke to just recognize one.  So that's when I decided. But I was still smoking. But I decided because I knew, I already had it. So it's time to --- sabi ko. And a national law, para lahat na, that at 12 o' clock, everything closes.  I am not trying to pull a chair here. Mine was that two o'clock noon sa Davao, it was two then I reduced it to one. When that boxing mayor there became mayor, she reduced it to six. Walang order, no orders in advance.  Kasi we have ordered already, so you can close but we have to drink. Itong ngayon, at 12, everything closes down. Nobody works. So I... I think that we should adopt it. Most of the states, in many states, in many countries, ganun man. Alas dose, sarado na talaga.  We have to stop drinking. And jukebox, they're only good up to eight, nine. Eight, maganda 'yan. It's a... It’s there in every corner, store. Blares out noise and the children who will go to school and the working class, and you are there with your store.  I have prohibited it in Davao. And at 12, as you see, Davao is quiet because everybody is resting already. Be it in the memorial parks, cemetery, or in the comfort of their homes.  The valuation system has also to be improved local government units and rationalize capital income [taxation]. I urge Congress to review and pass the Government Rightsizing Bill to reconfigure the existing Metro Manila-centric bureaucracy; streamline government systems in order to deliver services without delay and within a short timeline.These reforms would be for naught if we cannot avert of a “new poor” every time a disaster strikes. The Philippine experience has shown that natural disasters and --- are poverty creators.  That is why, we need to hasten the establishment of a Department of Disaster Resilience (DDR) so that these department focus on the natural hazards and climate change. I urge Congress to fast-track the passage of the Administration of this bill --- Administration version rather. In 2017, I reminded all of you of the probable consequence of a catastrophic earthquake in Metro Manila and its surrounding provinces. Since then, I have established the Project Management Office for the Earthquake Resilience and the Greater Manila Area to implement two-pronged strategy on earthquake resilience and mitigation efforts.  I just heard, it's not in my speech. I just heard that from a psychic that the first crack when the ""Big One"" hits, will be right here in the center of this… [laughter and applause]  ‘Yan man ang sabi nila. ""Philippines is so corrupt, it's so lousy that if you kill all congressmen, senators and the president, we will have a new day."" [laughter] So I pray that if the earthquake comes, it comes now. This moment. [laughter] Kumpleto na tayo. May madamay pa tayo doon sa harap. [laughter]  We weathered one damaging effect of climate change this year. The El Niño were wreaked havoc in the agricultural sector and caused water shortage in the greater Metro Manila area. We need to pass bill creating the Department of Water Resources and Water Regulatory Commission. [applause]  Alam mo, the agencies and the guys there handling the --- the entire water works system --- you have to change it immediately.  You know what, there was this three-day no water. I was in Davao. So everybody was complaining and I was even afraid to come here because what if my girlfriend will not be able to --- to take a bath. [laughter] She will smell like hell. So I said, I'll wait for the water to wash her.  Alam mo kung hindi ako nagmura, kung hindi ko sinabi, “p**** i**, papatayin ko kayo, p**** i** niyo.” And then when I arrived in the morning, there was water. And my girlfriend was fresh. [laughter]  I also call on Congress to pass a law mandating a Fire Protection Modernization Program. Diyan tayo nagka-ano. If you go to Davao, you'llfind the best. The best of everything, 911, all the cameras, all the screens. We did that if you can find it.  Alam mo --- alam mo sabi ni... Is there… Sonny is here? Secretary Dominguez? Ah Sonny. Siya man ang magyayabang. Sabi niya, ""marami tayong pera"". Pero ‘pag tanungin namin siya doon sa Cabinet meeting, “tsk tsk tsk tsk, walang pera, walang pera”. [laughter] Si Diokno ganun rin kaya gi-tapon ko sa Central Bank. [laughter]  Every time sabihin mo, you know we discussed projects, we plan and we submit it to Congress, it’s final imprimatur. Eh ‘di kami ang, “May pera ba tayo diyan, sir? “Wala.” “Magkano?” “Four billion.” “Tsk tsk tsk tsk tsk that is not the tsk tsk practice. No money, no money.” P***. Saan pala ang pera natin dito? Sa bulsa ninyo? [laughter] Karaming collection natin dito. But Sonny says that we can fund. This one we have to answer.  Now, I would like to remind... Pagbigyan na lang ninyo ako tutal para naman ito sa lahat. Alas-sais pa nga ginugutom na kayo. Hindi pala kayo nag- merienda?  Alam mo, ever since na-integrate 'yan you would notice in your cities and provinces the deterioration of the service itself. Wala ng mga truck, luma na. And would you believe it in Davao City, I'll show it to you, we have a 1934 Studebaker fire truck. Maganda pa.  So we have to --- we have to do better than this. There are other cities which are utterly --- - utterly without the tools to respond the challenges of fire. We have to come up with something that is really good.  I mean at this age, it would be a shame if you cannot put up a fire in two days, three days, my God. We have to set aside.  Sonny, you have the money? [laughter] Oh yes. Oh see. Basta sa maraming tao mahiya man mag-deny. [laughter] Totoo 'yan. Totoo 'yan. We have the money so maybe Sonny can give you a figure that we can set aside.  Nakakahiya talaga itong ano natin. Ang Davao, meron. Davao has a very good 911. Hindi ako nagyayabang. And we have cameras in every corners that's why we can solve crimes immediately. And meron kaming 911. “What is your emergency?” That's the standard. So it's fire, they call the fire department.Sabi ko, ""911."" ""Yes."" ""What's your emergency?"" ""I --- I seemed to lost my - -- to have lost my girlfriend.” ""We know you, Mayor. You go back to Manila there are plenty left there. Go."" [laughter]  This will equip the fire --- Bureau of Fire Protection with tools to respond to the challenges. I further ask Congress to urgently pass the Na --- ito --- the National Land Use Act or NALUA within this year. [applause] Paki lang po. So that we can proceed with the new... Well, we can meet the --- the demands of the new investors coming in. Ang lupa natin ang problema eh.  A science-based national land use plan would serve as basis for the LGUs in crafting respective development plans, and help disperse economic activities to the countryside.  The dispersion of economic and business activities to Visayas and Mindanao is not just a campaign promise. It is an economic imperative and a key to our country’s sustainable and equitable development. We will encourage investments that would develop the rural areas and Metro Manila and other mega urban areas.  Let me cut here, tutal maliit na lang. I would just like to remind everybody. No offense intended to the mayors and governors to the local government. Pero 'yang style ninyo na it takes about three days, four days for the employees of a certain company, store, or whatever to go back and forth, back and forth.  When they go back, you have a new regulation. He gets it, he secures it and when he goes back, oh there's still you have to follow --- you have to get this paper.  I will tell you now. Hindi ako nagyayabang. In Davao, it's one hour unless there is a need for ocular inspection. I am directing you publicly mayors --- mayors. I am directing also the DILG, Secretary Año of the local government to see to it that this is honored. All clearances, permits emanating from your office that would need also your approval, must be out at the very least within three days. [applause]  You do not do that. I am directing si Secretary Año, is he here, sir? Nandito ka? Oh Secretary Año, he is the former chief of staff, he's also a military man.I want three days, unless there is an exceptional reason, three days, para hindi na magpa-balik-balik kasi diyan ang perahan eh. Pagdating doon meron na naman hingin, pagdating doon may hingin.  Kaya I said the Filipinos if it is done to you, I'm telling you, slap the guy, create a scene, create a scandal because that incident however little will reach me. And if it does, you can be sure, if I do not call you and the idiot, I will go there myself. That is a promise, that is a pledge. [applause]  Make it a part of my oath of office. Lahat kayo diyan pati ‘yang tsk --- easement. Well, under Villar, okay na. Pero 'yang easement billion dollar --- ah billion pesos. Well, if it’s a foreign company, it's a billion dollar thing.  Ganun 'yan. Pabalik-balik at hindi binabayaran. That's why nagpatong... If all moneys and revenues due government are collected in good faith, marami tayong pera. I'm telling you as President. Marami tayong pera para extra money to uplift the --- the mass of Filipinos who are suffering. Maski ospital lang and housing.  Jobs, it's the economy that runs it. If the economy is good, more jobs. At the meantime, itong hospitalization, education, the basic things at saka itong relocation. Kaawa talaga.  Kung makolekta lang lahat hindi ma-corrupt ang pera, marami tayong pera. Kaya ako nagsabi. That's why I --- I resi...  You know, I will make it public. I was at the Nayong Pilipino. I gave it to a group of people. Tapos nagpa-bidding sila. Ang nagbidding nila is to allow a gambling casino to be erected there inside the Nayong Pilipino.  Kaya ko nagsabi t*** i** ninyo. Anong kahulugan ng Nayong Pilino kung lagyan mo ng sugalan and without a bidding? You know, nandiyan na 'yung mga generals, they are there, chief of staff. Kasi pag galing doon pumunta ako sa command conference. Pagdating ko sa command conference, may ipinasa si Sonny ghost delivery sa AFP hospital. Eh galing pa ako doon sa...  When I was facing the military and police, sabi ko, “Look, I thought I had my back covered by you? If I cannot trust you, you better tell me now. Because if you the commanders of the Air Force, Army pati Albayalde and the Navy, Iwill step down now. I am resigning, I'll go back to Davao. You do the explaining to the people why.""  Ginanun ko talaga. And in one of the Cabinet meetings ganun rin. There was this two-year, pabalik-balik na 'yung --- back and forth, back and forth, for two years it was sitting on their ass, the papers.  So when they were explaining to me the revised plan and with so many requirements, clearances from NBI, I stood up with the Cabinet members, lahat kami. In a Cabinet meeting I said, “Stop. That idiotic matrix is not for me. That is intended for the next --- maybe the president after the next.” Lumabas ako sabi ko, ""Inyo na 'yang gobyerno ninyo.""  Sabi ko wala ako... I --- I'm tired. I'm tired and I am... Talagang gusto ko na rin mag-resign. Sabi ko I am not happy anymore. Sabi ko anytime --- ah the military said, if you want to go out? If you want to take over coup d'etat, go ahead. Do not bring your armors. Do not bring your weapons here. Just call me and we'll have coffee.  I do not believe. I think Marcos and Estrada were correct that they did not allow the... Kasi 'yung guwardiya mo, guwardiya dito, pareho 'yan. Lahat sila dadaan 'yan sa presidential command. All of them will be assigned. Nag- iikot 'yan sila lahat. A taste of everything. Hanggang Mindanao kaya kilala ko 'yan sila lahat dumaan ng Mindanao eh.  Sabi ko talaga, ""Inyo na. Ayaw ko na."" Sabi ko, ""Sige, sinong gusto? Raise your right hands. I…” “I…” “Duly appointed member of the junta, will now make the SONA next month.""  Ah bahala kayo diyan. You threatened about... If you think that you can run the country better than the elected one, go ahead. That’s not my --- it’s the problem of the Filipino people.  Talaga sa Cabinet na --- na tsk... Kaya abutan ako ng topak, magbaba dito ako ngayon. Bahala na kayo diyan. I'm going home.One ese --- one estimate pegs economic losses at P3.5 billion a day due to traffic congestion in Metro Manila. So meantime, I reiterate my directive, my request, my pleadings to the MMDA and all concerned local officials in Metro Manila, and all other cities, to undertake immediate action to ensure the speedy and smooth flow of vehicular traffic. Reclaim all public roads that are being used for private ends. Marami diyan. [applause]  And again, I asked Secretary Año to see to it that this is enforced. If there is a mayor or a governor, or kung ano kang --- sino kang demonyo ka, i- suspend mo Sir Año. Give him time and if he cannot --- if he is not up to it, then pagpahingain mo na lang. Suspend mo na. Wala talagang --- wala tayong magawa.  They just keep on pleasing their own constituents just because they are constituents --- a leader. Ganun kayo eh. The only way to do it... Anyway, me, I have no problem. Me, I am an inutil official. Me, I cannot run anymore. Me, after six years I might lose my head. Wala na ako. I... No more challenges in politics. No more mountains to climb. I will just do my duty.  And most of my Cabinet members are actually military men. You know why? Gusto ninyong malaman? Do not be embarrassed. Atin-atin na lang ito. Huwag mo na silang pansinin, 'yang mga ano diyan. Parang nag meeting- meeting lang tayo dito. [laughter] 'Yung parang nagpulung-pulong lang. Do not mind them. Eh kung tignan kasi ninyo mahiya kayo.  Kasi ganito 'yan, my penchant for military men. I want to ingratiate myself to them? What? I was elected by the people, not by the military, not by the police. But to --- why do I have this I said --- this predisposed of… Kasi utusan sila madali. Kasi 'pag sinabi mong walang corruption, walang corruption. Kaya lang ang military and just like any organization, 'pag ang top diyan general o ang commander-in-chief corrupt, ku-corrupt 'yan lahat.  Pero kung sabihin mo na matino ka, they will follow. So Boracay I sent Cimatu. Sabi ko, ""Puntahan mo nga doon."" Is General Cimatu here, si Roy? Ah yeah.  Itong si Roy nakilala ko ito sa Mindanao. Hindi ko man 'yan kilala. Mindanao... Na-mayor kasi ako 23 years. So all of them passed by Mindanao, kilala ko. 'Pag inutusan mo, kaagad. And they know that I will notgive illegal orders for them to implement. Alam nila abugado ako. Sabi ko sundin lang ako ninyo.  Kaya I was surprised when I ordered Cimatu to go there --- to Boracay, Sir Frank. Alam mo ang ginawa niya? The next day lumabas siya roon sa Daily Mirror. Naglalakad siya doon sa beach, naka-t-shirt ng blue at 'yung mata niya nandoon sa dalawang Caucasian na nag... [laughter]  ""G****** it, Cimatu. Akala ko ba inutusan kita?"" ""Yes, sir."" ""O bakit ka nagpalakad-lakad diyan sa beach tinitignan mo 'yung naka-bikini na dalawang puti?"" ""Sir, napadaan lang ako sir."" Sabi ko, ""Trabahuin mo 'yan ha."" And they did it in six months’ time. Of course with a... [applause] I like Cimatu because he mixed his pleasure with work. [laughter] That is the way how to do it. [laughter]  I give you until the last week of the year 'yung sa --- September na to do this. Clean the LGUs. Walang mangyari dito.  We shall continue to invest in the countryside through agricultural programs that will increase the productivity and income of our small farmers and fisherfolk. We shall ensure the full implementation of the Rice Tariffication Law, including the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund. This will safeguard the livelihood of small farmers through the provisions of modern farm equipment and machineries, seeds and credit, and extension services.  I also have not forgotten my commitment to uplift the lives --- ito --- coconut farmers and further develop the coconut industry until the urgent -- - ah through the urgent utilization of the Coconut Levy Fund. That is 100 million. [applause] Kaya ako very careful until now wala akong nakuha. Look, it is really hard to look for an honest man. I must admit it. Baka ako hindi ko rin kaya. I do not have that well...  Itong coco fund na ito, ito 'yung naiwan sa --- noong kay Marcos na levy fund. This is sacred money. This money was taken out of the pockets of the Filipinos arbitrarily. Wala kang magawa noon eh martial law. Ito na 'yan.  Kaya itong coco levy fund, kung sabihin mo lang, tama ang Supreme Court. Hindi mo pwedeng maibigay --- sabi mo sino. You can no longer trace the truthful owner of the land.Ang plano ko, kung gusto ninyo, you save the money. You invest the money. Siguro mag-abot 'yan ng mga more than 100 billion. Ilagay na lang ninyo ng ano trust fund for the government. It’s about mga 5 billion. Ayon na lang ang gastusin ninyo to reserve the money. Rather than do it parang sprinkle na ibigay mo sa mga tao. You cannot --- sabi ng Supreme Court tama sila -- - you can no longer trace the genealogy of the owners --- the original owners. And sometimes it would fail.  I will not act on that until I find the money. Wala pa akong nakuha. I have yet --- I have yet to look for the money. Hanggang ngayon naghahanap ako. Wala akong makita. Kasi malaki ito and this will --- this will, you know, if you assign a corrupt idiot there. Kaya gusto --- ang gusto ko o baka nagustuhan rin ninyo, i-deposito ko na lang. Let it remain as a remembrance to the people who lost their ah --- at that time. Tapos 'yung 5 billion, 'yon 'yung to improve the econo --- the improvement sa replanting sa coconut.  Five billion, that’s a big money. Pero kung ibigay mo, let it sprinkler, walang mangyayari. 'Yung taga-bigay kukuha 'yan --- 'yung pupunta. That's why itong Land Bank na ito, 'pag hindi ito na... You know, you are called Land Bank but you are now the number one commercial bank in the Philippines.  What the heck is happening to you? You are supposed to finance agricultural enterprises and endeavors. Bakit wala? [applause] Bakit --- why can't you just buy a few wagons or whatever? Go to the countryside and ask the people if there are cooperatives, tulungan ninyo to form one. [applause]  'Pag wala, eh tignan ninyo na maibigay ninyo for replanting of the coconut -- - to revive the coconut industry. Pahiramin ninyo ng pera plus the money --- 'nung sabi ko of the coconut levy. That is sacred money. Land Bank should go back to land. Why are you mired in so many commercial transactions? Bumalik kayo where you were created for and that is to help the farmers. Ilang administration na wala? [applause] You better decide on that, I will give you until the end of July to give me a plan or else I will ask Congress to reconfigure you what-not. Wala eh, wala kayong... [applause]  I'm asking now Congress, 'pag wala sila --- if there is no viable plan for that for the farmers and it is just all commercial transactions, might as well abolish it and give the money to the congressmen for their developmentfunds. [laughter] O mas makatulong pa. Diretso eh. Ayaw ninyo? [laughter] O ayaw daw nila, Sir Frank. Huwag mo na lang galawin.  I once again urge both Houses of Congress to pass a more responsive version of the bill establishing the Coconut Farmers’ Trust Fund to ensure the accelerated utilization of coco levy funds for the well-being and empowerment of the coconut farmers. [applause]  We recognize the urgent need to ensure the sustainability and availability of resources and the development of alternative ones. In this regard, I trust that Secretary Cusi shall fast-track also the development of renewable energy sources, and reduce dependence on the traditional energy sources such as coal.  Finally, sustaining our gains entails a national security posture capable of defending the country from external and internal security threats. Defense Secretary Lorenzana, together with the gallant men and women of the armed forces, is at the forefront of this fight.  We expect support for legislative initiatives aimed at strengthening defense- related systems such as the proposed National Defense Act, the Unified Military and Uniformed Personnel Separation, Retirement, and Pension Bill, and the revival of the mandatory ROTC in Grades 11 and 12. [applause]  Very important. Alam mo ‘pag mag giyera-giyera, 10 out of 10 hindi marunong maghawak ng baril to defend even his father and mother and brothers and sisters. Itong mga bata ngayon, they are bereft of the patriotism and the love of country. Balik sila dito.  I think a military training would be good for everybody. Kung hindi sige lang --- sa shabu, mamaya namatay, krrrkkk. “Duterte: Extrajudicial killing. Report to the ICC.” Ah okay. If you can provide me with a good comfortable cell, heated during winter time, I want to go --- and an air-conditioned during hot weather. And a conjugal visits, unlimited, [laughter] para we can understand each other.We are aware of the fact that there are times in AFP and PNP personnel, while in the performance of their duties, get unjustly sued. Providing them with free legal assistance to help and boost their morale.  My fellow citizens, to borrow the words of Churchill --- akin ‘to, this is mine: We are now entering a period of consequences. The consequences of what we did and did not do but should have done during my first half of my term. I assume full responsibility for that. As President, I cannot pass it --- the blame to anybody. So it’s on me.  Though we cannot change the past, we will not squander the future. I will push harder in the pursuit of programs that we have started, but always within the parameters of the law. I will not merely coast along or while away my time during  the  remaining  years  of   my   administration.   It   ain’t   my   style. [applause] But I will not stop until I reach the finish line. Then and only then shall I call it a day. [applause]  Our goal for the next three years is clear: a comfortable life for everybody, all Filipinos. We have made significant strides and accomplished signal milestones as a nation in the past three years. This momentum must continue with greater fervor in the next three years and beyond.  I dream of glowing days ahead for every Filipino. I dream of a Philippines better than the one I grew up with.  This is my pledge and commitment for just three years, if I can. If I cannot, I’m sorry. But I shall continue to comply with my constitutional duty to serve and protect the Filipino, until the last day of my term.  God Bless the  Filipino.  God  Bless  the  Philippines.  Thank  you  very  much! [applause]    --- END ---"

5TH STATE  OF THE  NATION  ADDRESS  OF  
RODRIGO ROA DUTERTE   
PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES   
TO THE CONGRESS OF THE PHILIPPINES  
  
[Delivered at the Session Hall of the House of Representatives, Batasang 
Pambansa Complex, Quezon City | 27 July 2020]  
  
  
Kindly…  
  
Senate President Vicente Sotto III and the honorable members of the 
Senate; House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano and the honor able members of 
the House of Representatives; Vice President Maria Leonor Robredo; former 
Presidents Joseph Ejercito Estrada and Gloria  Macapagal -Arroyo; Chief 
Justice Diosdado Peralta and the justices of the Supreme Court ; His 
Excellency Munther Mafoodh S alim Al -Mantheri and the esteemed members 
of the diplomatic corps; Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and the 
members of the Cabinet; mga mahal kong kababayan.  
  
We live in a troubled time. Our dream of prosperity for our country was 
suddenly snuffed b y a pandemic virulent virus. No nation was spared. 
Neither rich nor poor were exempt from the onslaught of this deadly disease.  
  
But let us not despair. The vaccine is around the corner. Sooner and not 
later, the virus that gobbled up thousands of lives w ill itself be laid to rest.  
  
In the meantime, let us express the nation‘s gratitude to those who 
courageously and willingly put their lives on the line to serve the people and 
country. We share the  griefs of their families and no amount of tears can 
compe nsate their great losses.  
  
My countrymen, it is sad that while government focuses its attention and 
resources to battle the coronavirus, there are those who take advantage of a 
pre-occupied government.  
  
One of them is Senator Frank Drilon. In an intervie w, he arrogantly 
mentioned among others that oligarchs need not be rich. Then he linked the 
anti-dynasty system with oligarchy and the topic was my daughter and son. 
This happened after the Committee on Franchise voted 70 -11 to deny thegrant of franchise to ABS -CBN. Obviously, he was defending the Lopezes 
that they are not oligarchs.  
  
Great wealth enables economic elites and corporations to influence public 
policy to their advantage. Media is a powerful tool in the hands of oligarchs 
like the Lopezes who used their media outlets in their battles with political 
figures. I am a casualty o f the Lopezes during the 2016 election.  
  
The dealers and purveyors of illegal drugs, hiding in the shadow of COVID -
19, have stepped up their activities. The amount of shabu valued at millions 
of pesos seized during police operations speak volumes of the e normity and 
weight of the problem that we bear.  
  
The corrupt, the grafters and the influence peddlers also take advantage of 
the fear and confusion that the coronavirus generates. The financial and 
material assistance of the government to the unemployed, the sick and the 
destitute running into billions of pesos, are not spared from corruption and 
ineptitude. Even the donations from well -meaning private persons are 
skimmed before reaching their intended beneficiaries. It is like snatching 
food from the mout hs of babes.  
  
The profiteers, over -pricers and corrupt felons must be laughing while they 
stash their dirty monies. But not for long. They cannot outrun the long arm 
of the law.  
  
In this regard, the words of former President Ramon Magsaysay ring fresh 
and relevant today as on the day they were said decades ago. He said:  
  
―We need men of integrity and faith like Rizal and del Pilar, men of action 
like Bonifacio, men of inflexible patriotism like Mabini. We need their zeal, 
their self -reliance, their capac ity for work, their devotion to service, their 
ability to lose themselves in the common cause of building a nation.‖  
  
If we allow greed, self -interest and ambition to rule us, then as stated by 
one prominent physician, we will ―be left with nothing better  than the lesser 
evil instead of the greater good.‖  
  
In my inaugural address four years ago, I said that no leader can succeed at 
anything of national importance [or] significance unless he has the 
cooperation and support of the people he is tasked to lea d and sworn to 
serve.The efforts and resources which we poured out produced the momentum 
needed to bring our country closer to our goals. Suffice it to state, we made 
significant strides over time.  
  
Over 4.3 million poor families benefitted from the  Pantawid Pamilya ; over 
9.2 million beneficiaries received subsidies under the Unconditional Cash 
Transfer program; we also made available [free] tertiary education and 
universal health care. Public utility drivers were given assistance through the 
Pantawid P asada Program. There are complaints that some drivers did not 
receive any assistance at all. I have directed the DSWD and DILG to look 
into this.  
  
I welcome the passage of the law postponing the Barangay and Sangguniang 
Kabataan Elections. The postponemen t saved much -needed government 
funds and ensured implementation of projects under the current barangay 
officials. In hindsight, it also saved us from holding the polls while we dealt 
and continue to deal with the pandemic.  
  
The Malasakit Centers Act has p roven to be of great help to our less 
fortunate citizens needing medical services through a one -stop platform in 
government hospitals. We commend the initiative and work of Senator Bong 
Go in this regard as well as other significant pieces of legislation. As of 
today, there are 75 Malasakit Centers serving Filipinos all over the country. 
These centers will be of great help in ensuring that our people remain 
healthy and resilient during these challenging times.  
  
  
The Salary Standardization Law of 2019 incr eases the salary of civilian 
government workers. I hope that this law will inspire our government 
workers to perform better and encourage young, brilliant citizens to join 
public service.  
  
I appreciate the law establishing the National Academy of Sports. We can 
now give our deserving student -athletes the training and support they need 
to excel in their chosen field of endeavors.  
  
  
With the commitment of key members of Congress and the Executive 
Department, the PHISGOC, Philippine Sports Commission, and the Philippine 
Olympic Committee were bound together with one vision to host the 
30th Southeast Asian Games. Our athletes prevailed.  More than that, we 
fostered pride, patriotism, genuine sportsmanship, and camaraderie in our 
South East Asian brothers and sisters. Indeed, we won as one.To our business community and the general public, we assure you that the 
landmark Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery 
Act has been gaining momentum. We are closer to eliminating 
overregulation in government services.  
  
Frontline processes, including consular services, processing of building and 
business permits, and servi ces for overseas Filipinos and seafarers were 
streamlined. Passports and drivers‘ license validity were lengthened to ease 
the burden of the public.  
  
We received a BBB plus credit rating despite a sea of credit rating 
downgrades and negative outlook revisions worldwide.  [applause]  The Japan 
Credit Rating Agency upgraded us from BBB plus to A minus last month.  
  
Meanwhile, Moody‘s has affirmed and mainta ined the country‘s ratings at B2 
--- Baa2 rather.  [Understand. Because of the light I have … My eyesight is 
not as good as new.]  Our fiscal position is strong, our economic and fiscal 
management prudent and our banking system robust. We are in a better 
position to weather the crisis caused by the COVID -19 global pandemic.  
  
  
We have accomplished significant infrastructure projects under the Build 
Build Build Program.   I will not dwell lengthily on the nitty -gritty of our 
infrastructure accomplishments now lest I bore you. Instead we will release 
a comprehensive written report on our collective milestones and the details 
of accomplishments to remind us that perseverance, patience and 
determination will help us move forward even in the most difficult of times . 
  
We issued last year Executive Order No. 100 establishing the Diversity and 
Inclusion Program as a national program of the Government. We want to 
end the discrimination of persons on the basis of age, disability, ethnicity, 
sexual orientation and gender  identity and expression, and other character 
traits.  
  
My administration always believed that freedom from illegal drugs, 
terrorism, corruption and criminality, is itself a [human right].  
  
Part of our efforts to uphold human rights is protection of the r ights of 
children and the right against discrimination. Early last year, I signed 
Executive Order No. 92 creating the National Council Against Child Labor. 
Government efforts to protect the rights of children will be amplified to 
prevent, reduce and elimin ate any form of child labor.Our achievements along these lines have been extolled by an overwhelming 
number of our fellow member -States in the UN Human Rights Council, 
during its recently held 44th session last June.  
  
Rest assured that we will not dodg e our obligation to fight for human rights.   
  
My countrymen, there are lessons to be learned from the coronavirus 
pandemic. It jolted us to realize that gains made after spending so much 
planning, effort, cost and time could diminish considerably and quic kly for 
reasons beyond one‘s anticipation; that it is much easier to destroy than to 
build; that in a crisis of national proportions that affects every aspect of 
human life, governments need to have the support and cooperation of the 
people if it is to suc ceed in battling the cause of that crisis, that there are 
people who ask for compassion but show none themselves; that life, after 
all, is fickle like the weather.  
  
The gains we achieved in the first three and a half years were put to a test 
when the pand emic suddenly struck the global community. While I am aware 
that the road towards a comfortable life for all would be far easy if pandemic 
had not occurred and along the rest of the world we suffered.  
  
The global scale and socio -economic impact of the COVID -19 pandemic has 
been unprecedented. Yet in the throes of this global health emergency, we 
have been able to withstand the headwinds generated by this coronavirus.  
  
In this regard I would like to expr ess my gratitude to all those who made 
possible the steady supply of food, water, and basic utilities [to] our 
households  [applause]  and the provision of basic social services and financial 
assistance to our people. Our profound gratitude goes to everyone who 
helped keep our country‘s food supply chain running, the valiant soldiers, 
policemen and security guards who kept peace and order  [applause]  in our 
communities; the dedicated personnel who kept our essential establishments 
operational. You showed us ki ndness and selflessness. You gave us strength. 
You risked your own lives to serve the greater good in keeping with the 
Filipino spirit of  Bayanihan.  [applause]  
  
  
I also thank the men and women of the Inter -Agency Task Force on 
Emerging Infectious Disease s and the National Task Force against COVID -19 
for all the countless hours it spent to keep the pandemic in check and for all 
the efforts it made to ensure the safety of our people.  [applause]Let me also recognize the efforts of the local government u nits that stepped 
up and initiated their own response measures to contain the effects of 
COVID -19 and its impact to their constituents. Have been --- impact to its 
constituents.  [The shadow says it’s a period there.]  
  
I know exactly the difficulties you a re undergoing. I pray that the officials of 
each LGU in our country – from the barangay to the autonomous regions – 
would set aside partisan politics and selfish interests to do what is right and 
good for all.  [applause]  
  
I likewise issued Executive Order No. 104, which imposed ceilings on the 
retail prices of at least 133 drugs and medicines, and directed a continuous 
review of the retail prices of others. This proved to be providential now that 
we are facing a pandemic.  
  
To everyone who helped us in this time of great need,  maraming salamat 
po. [applause]  
  
Let me say that the strength of a nation rests in the hands of the people 
acting as one with government, in the pursuit of common goals and 
objectives.  
  
When the pand emic struck, I decided to prioritize life over other 
considerations. According to experts, the interventions that the government 
had put in place prevented as much as 1.3 to 3.5 million infections. To me, 
even if the numbers were much lower, it would still  be and would have been 
worth the sacrifice[s] we made. ― Buhay muna, bago ang lahat.”  [applause]  
  
We initially encountered difficulties ramping up our testing capacity. We now 
have 93 accredited testing laboratories nationwide and we are aiming to 
conduct  1.4 million tests by end of July and ensure a quick turnaround time 
of 48 to 72 hours.   
  
Under the Social Amelioration Program, we allotted [PhP205 billion] for poor 
and low -income households who were affected during this pandemic --- who 
thrive on a ―no -work, no -pay‖ arrangement. Admittedly, our implementation 
of the Social Amelioration Program was not perfect. And some opportunists 
turned crisis into opportunity. We will catch up with you sooner than you 
think.  
  
We came up with the COVID -19 Adjustment Measures Program. We 
extended financial assistance to over 650,000 affected individuals in the 
formal sector, 110,000 OFWs abroad, and almost 83,000 repatriated 
OFWs. We also provided temporary wage employment [opportunities] todisplaced marginalized work ers through the TUPAD Project. Our indigent 
senior citizens were also provided with a stipend for the [first] semester of 
the current year.  
  
This health emergency stretched the government‘s resources to its limits. In 
response, the Office of the President  worked closely with Congress for the 
quick passage of the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act.  
  
May I again reiterate my thanks to you, the men and women of Congress, 
for the effort you invested into passing that law. I hope that we can get 
some or the same treatment of clarity, purpose and the 
fastness  [applause]  to support the passage of the Bayani han [to Recover as 
One Act], which will supplement funds for recovery and response against the 
impact of the COVID -19 pandemic.  
  
We must facilitate the country‘s economic recovery. I call on Congress to 
fast-track the passage of proposed measures such as the Corporate 
Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises or CREATE Act.  [applause]  This 
immediately cuts the corporate income levy from the current 30 to 25 
percent and give the government flexibility to grant a combination of fiscal 
and non -fiscal incent ives, among others. The Financial Institutions Strategic 
Transfer or FIST Act will set up mechanisms allowing banks and other 
financial institutions to dispose of and transfer non -performing assets and 
loans to asset management companies similar to Special  Purpose Vehicles.  
  
Our economic managers have seen infrastructure investment as an effective 
tool to help spur high growth, attract investments, create jobs, and achieve 
financial inclusion for all Filipinos. The [DPWH] has resumed the construction 
of the North Luzon Expressway Harbor Link, the NLEX -SLEX Connector, the 
Cavite -Laguna Expressway, the Metro Manila Skyway Stage 3, the R -1 
Bridge Project, the Tarlac -Pangasinan -La Union Expressway Project, and the 
Subic Freeport Expressway Project, to name a fe w. To realize the maximum 
benefit from the country‘s investments, the infrastructure projects under the 
Build, Build, Build Program, which are labor and capital intensive, are not 
mere springboards for the country‘s swift recovery [post] -pandemic. They 
are economic benefits --- economic benefits to be distributed to all corners 
of the country and push sustainability in urban centers, particularly [Metro] 
Manila.  
  
  
The TESDA launched an online mode of livelihood and skills training. There 
are 71 free onlin e training to help upskill trainees for the right 
opportunities.  [opportunities, I’m sorry]I ask the TESDA to come up with special training programs to retool our 
OFWs so they can find employment opportunities here at home. I am also 
calling on the CHED  for scholarship programs for the qualified dependents of 
our OFWs. I direct the Department of Agriculture and DTI to come up with 
agri-business and entrepreneurship projects to help displaced OFWs rebuild 
their livelihood. Further, I ask the LANDBANK and other government 
financial institutions to continue providing low -interest loans to our 
OFWs.  Sa mga kababayan ko na naghihirap sa ibang bansa, nandito ang 
inyong gobyerno para matulungan kayo at inyong mga pamilya, lalo na sa 
panahong ito.  [applause]  
  
The government will intensify its efforts to help businesses, especially our 
micro, small and medium enterprises or MSMEs, by providing responsive 
government assistance and services, capitalization, and business operations 
support as we adapt to the next nor mal. [applause]  
Nananawagan po ako sa ating mga  lessors – nananawagan po ako sa ating 
mga lessors:  malasakit at Bayanihan po sana ang pairalin natin ngayon.  This 
is not the time to drive away lessees. During normal times they were the 
primary source of your income stream. Now, it‘s time to be fair and 
compassionate. Come up with amenable arrangement with your 
tenants.  Huwag po natin silang ipagtabuyan, tanggal an ng tubig, kuryente, 
at bubong.  Commercial establishments are requested to give grace periods 
[or] allow deferment of payments, especially for MSMEs that were forced to 
close down during the quarantine period.   Let us help them 
recover.  [applause]  
  
We pump-primed the recovery and rehabilitation of MSMEs. The DTI, 
through the Small Business Corporation, set up the PhP1 -billion COVID -19 
Assistance to Restart Enterprises or CARES Program to provide zero -interest 
loans for MSMEs affected by the pandemic. As of July 10, 2020, over 2,600 
loan applications worth [PhP182.5 million] have been approved. We are 
optimistic that this initiative will help our MSMEs stabilize and recover from 
their losses.  
  
I also enjoin the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas and banks operat ing in the 
country to provide regulatory relief for our MSMEs and allow loan payment 
extensions, without incurring penalties and charges.  [applause]  We need 
your help to prevent the collapse of companies saddled with accumulated 
amortizations and payables caused by the closure of their businesses at the 
height of the strict quarantine periods.  
  
  
As we embark on these efforts towards inclusive recovery, we should 
acknowledge that all forms of government support will go to naught if thenew MSMEs do not thr ive because of lack of consumer support.  Ito ang 
panahon para suportahan natin ang ating mga kababayan [applause] na 
nagnenegosyo at gumagawa ng mga produktong sariling atin.   
  
In the same manner, the tourism and recreation industries, which are 
among the  hardest hit by the pandemic, count on our full support. While we 
slowly try to put the fun back in our local travels, the national government 
agencies and LGUs must harmonize their policies to boost tourism [while] 
ensuring everyone‘s well -being. We enjoi n our people to help boost the 
economy by traveling locally  [applause] [local na lang]  once the necessary 
systems are in place.  
  
The DoST offers its Enterprise Technology Upgrading Program to enable 
businesses to access training that will help them transi tion to online and 
contactless operations.  
  
Now more than ever, we need to protect our consumers. I direct the 
Department of Trade and Industry to ensure the empowerment of Filipinos 
on their consumer rights, and coordinate strategies between public and 
private organizations in building a fair, safe, resilient, and sustainable 
economy.  [applause]  
  
There are welcome developments for the e -Commerce industry. But major 
economic activities take place in a borderless environment with meager 
regulatory controls . They expose consumers to various risks related to 
security, data privacy, and misrepresentation.  
  
We must patrol the country‘s cyberspace and enforce online consumer and 
data protection and privacy laws. We must run after online scammers and 
those undermining the people‘s trust in online transactions. We must 
continue to protect Filipinos in the new no rmal and remind the world that we 
are responsible stewards of data. I am committed to protect both the 
physical and digital lives of our law -abiding countrymen.  [applause]  
  
  
The national government shall lead the way in our transition to online 
systems. I reiterate my call for all government instrumentalities to 
implement systems that shall make physical queuing a thing of the past.  
  
  
Panahon na para mawala [applause] na ang pila para mapagsilbihan ang 
gobyerno nang walang kahirapan para sa tao . The DIL G, DBM, and the 
ARTA, along with all agencies and instrumentalities of government, are 
hereby directed to make [all] possible services available online. We need toadjust to and adopt a paper -less type business and work performance. We 
need e -governance [t o provide] our people with the services they need 
[from] the comfort of their homes or workplaces. It will enable our 
bureaucracy to better transition into in the 'new normal' and cut or minimize 
red tape.  
  
  
Until the COVID -19 vaccine is available, I wil l not allow the traditional face -
to-face teaching or learning unless [all] risks of exposure to sickness are 
eliminated. I cannot and will not put to risk the health and lives of our 
students and teachers.  [applause]  
  
Iyong....  About  two weeks  ago, I --- I seemed  to have said that I would  
allow the face-to-face classes  to resume.  But we were talking  actually  of 
January  because  my thinking  is that by September,  we would  have the 
vaccine.  How to get it from the producers  or from other  governments  is 
really  something  which  we have to deal with because  everyone  --- the...  It's 
a global  need and everyone  will go for it.  
 
But let me just mention  it in passing  that about  four days ago, I made  a plea 
to President  Xi Jinping  that if they have the vaccine,  can they allow us to be 
one of the first or if it is needed,  if we have to buy it, that we will be granted  
credit  so that we can normalize  as fast as possible.  
  
Life that is lost is lost forev er. Courses that are not substantial can be 
supplemented. Education that is delayed can be recovered.  
  
  
We must implement online learning, modular learning, and TV - and radio -
based broadcast, which students coming from different backgrounds can 
avail. De pEd will provide printed modules for those who cannot afford online 
learning.    
  
In support of the Learning Continuity Program through blended learning, we 
plan to increase the number of schools with ICT equipment in the coming 
months.  
  
  
The DepEd and t he DICT are building up the Public Education Network or 
PEN that will connect all public schools and DepEd offices nationwide. We will 
prioritize the connection of all Last Mile Schools and those with no electricity 
supply can have it via satellite and ene rgized via solar panels. By 2022,before I step down, the PEN shall be realized.  [applause]  I‘m referring to the 
program. I will --- I will do it.  
  
TV frequencies reverted back to the government for whatever cause or 
reason [shall be used] exclusively to the exclusion of [private] persons or 
[their] dummies, to cope with the demand of the next normal. These will be 
used to provide uninterrupted quality education to our children in our shift to 
e-learning.  
  
I am directing Secretary Guevarra, Secretary Dela  Peña and Secretary 
Honasan, in collaboration with Secretary Briones, and Secretary Avisado, 
together with Secretary Dominguez, to come up with an integrated program 
and implementation mechanism to ensure that these TV frequencies are fully 
utilized by gov ernment through the facilities of PTV4 for the utmost benefit 
of the Filipino people.  [applause]  
  
Let me just --- allow me to segue a little bit. For the remaining two years of 
my term, all that is good that belongs to government, whether it be the 
airwaves, whether it be the lines, or whatever that is good for the people, 
will belong to the government  and it should be government who should be 
given the first option to utilize them. Ang sobra, kanila.  [applause]  
  
I call on our [telecommunication] companies to improve their services lest 
we be forced to take drastic steps to address the less -than-ideal service that 
the public is getting from you.  
  
Alam mo sisingit na lang ako dito. I am... Sometimes we are a government 
pictured to be weak and incompetent because we cannot really force our 
mandate. Alam mo itong nagbibigay ng mga public services, you bet ter 
improve.   
  
Huwag naman ninyo kaming pahintayin sampung taon bago kami 
makakamit ng mga services that the other countries are enjoying. If it's just 
a question of added capitalization or the infusion of money, go and look for 
it. Maghanap kayo because if you are not ready to improve --- anak --- I 
might just as well close all of you and we revert back to the line telephone at 
kukunin ko 'yan, i -expropriate ko sa gobyerno.  
  
Alam mo itong… I'll be straight, iyong Smart pati itong Globe, ilang taon na 
ito, at ang sagot palagi sa akin, ""the party cannot be reached."" Eh nasaan 
pala pumunta 'yung y*** na 'yon?  
  
Eh kung ganoon lang naman ibigay ninyo sa amin, we are a republic, a 
sovereign country, bear that in mind because the patience of the Filipinopeople  is reaching its limit, at I will be the one to articulate the anger of the 
Filipino people. And you might not want what I intend to do with you.  
  
Kindly improve the services before December. I want to call Jesus Christ to 
Bethlehem. Better have that line cleared.  [applause]  Alam mo sa totoo lang, 
at the end --- naa-ano na ako sa inyo. I have been a citizen of this country 
and parang nilalaro lang ni nyo ang...  
  
Kayong may pera, p***. May pera kayo? Negosyo kayo. Wala kayong pera? 
P***, umalis kayo dito. You know, you give us half deals, half -cooked 
transactions, lousy service. Tapos ang tao nagbabayad.   
  
Tell us now if you cannot really improve on i t because I will work by 
December. I have two years. The next two years will be spent improving the 
telecommunications of this country without you. I will find a way. I will talk 
to Congress and find a way how to do it.  [applause]  
  
Last year, I said that distributing economic and business activities is 
imperative to our country‘s sustained and equitable growth. Today I 
reiterate that statement.  
  
I issued Administrative Order No. 18, directing concerned agencies to 
strengthen the development of Special Eco nomic Zones in areas outside 
Metro Manila.  
  
I also issued Executive Order No. 114 to institutionalize the Balik Probinsya, 
Bagong Pag -Asa Program. This consolidates and refocuses existing economic 
and social welfare programs, activities and projects towar d the countryside. 
It also [establishes] an [inter -agency] council, headed by Executive 
Secretary Salvador Medialdea, which will create a framework for the 
effective implementation of the project.  [Kung hindi ninyo ako naiintindihan 
sa binabasa ko, mas lal o ako.] [laughter]  
  
  
In 2021, we aim to increase access to healthcare services by continuously 
hiring and deploying more than 20,000 health professionals. This will 
augment health workforce in the LGUs, particularly in isolated and 
disadvantaged areas. W e will implement projects to establish and improve 
Barangay Health Stations, Rural Health Units, and other healthcare facilities.  
  
  
[But] we [still] need to address internal security. We are pursuing a whole -
of-nation approach to bring peace and order and development in the 
countryside. We need to provide interventions and implement the BarangayDevelopment Program. This would provide cleared and threatened 
communities and… This refers to a program where the Armed Forces would 
play a vital role in the one -nation approach. This is what simply --- mean by 
this. And that everyone, every agency of the government including the 
Armed Forces o f the Philippines should participate. And I am aware of the 
skirmishes and the assassination of our soldiers and I said, ―Correct this so 
that we can proceed with the barangay implementation as fast as possible.‖  
  
We have made significant strides in the p ast four years, but we need the 
support of local government leaders. We need your help to implement the 
Barangay Development Program.  
  
Certain sectors expressed concerns when I declared martial law in Mindanao 
and its extension three times. But 2019 ended  without my office requesting 
any further extension.  
  
Martial law in Mindanao ended without abuses by the civilian sector, by the 
police, by the military.  [applause]  It ended because this time I know that 
they know how to love the country.  
  
  
I thank Con gress for its support to this administration‘s programs. Congress 
has been very productive. But much more remains to be done.  
  
You know actually my speech if you followed it carefully, it‘s all a plea to 
Congress to do this, to do that, to make a law or c raft a whatever.  
  
And this one, I strongly urge Congress to pass a law establishing the 
Department of Overseas Filipinos [focused] solely on addressing the 
concerns of Filipinos abroad and their families.  
  
I reiterate the swift passage --- before that --- before this… Kawawa kasi 
itong ating mga overseas. If it‘s only an office there in the Labor department 
they are overworked or for whatever reason, their needs, their pleas are not 
really attended to with dispatch and with care. OFW pati itong ano ngayon  
ito ‗yung sinabi ko kanina, they --- I… I will go for it. We will need it to help 
them.  
  
I reiterate the swift passage of a law reviving the death 
penalty  [applause]  by lethal injection for crimes specified under the 
Comprehensive Dangerous [Drugs] Act o f 2002. I did not hear so much 
clapping so I presume that  [applause]  they are not interested. Wala kang… 
Someday I‘ll tell you the story what happened to the Philippines.Hindi ngayon. But when I‘m --- sasabihin ko sa inyo ang totoo bakit 
nagkaganito ‘yung droga ng Pilipinas. Why the drug syndicates continue to 
operate just like the countries of Colombia, Mexico, and it is being played 
inside the national penitentiaries. Pa ra tayong --- talagang binababoy tayo. 
Sabihin ko sa inyo. But this is not a time for storytelling. SONA kasi ito so 
dito na lang.  
  
This law will not only help us deter criminality but also save our children 
from the dangers posed by illegal and dangerous  drugs.  
  
  
May I be allowed with the indulgence of the body, itong bakit talaga ako 
galit sa droga. Let us make this a semi -formal speech. Alam mo kasi limang 
pamilya members o anim or pito, pagka bumagsak ‗yung tatay to drugs, the 
family crumbles. There‘ s no more home to them. Droga, and if he‘s receiving 
a salary naglala --- nagtatrabaho sa pantalan, 300 a day, tapos ang shabu is 
sold at two. He has about 100 to bring home. Kaya pagka ganun nagaaway -
away na, ang mga bata hindi nakakapag -aral, ‗yung iba l igaw na mga babae 
into early prostitution kung ano -ano nangyari. Hindi lang alam nitong mga --
- na this is happening all over the country everyday. And what is really very 
tragic is this, when the family starts to crumble, there‘s no home, and 
invariably t he wife would look for another… Now the husband will look for a 
job usually easily doon sa abroad. At ‗yung asawa aalis, ‗yung bana --- lalaki 
nasa droga, ‗yung mga anak iniiwan sa kapitbahay, sa kapatid. And the 
ferocity of the laws of the Filipino family  home has been destroyed. Kaya 
kung anong mangyari nito the wife works in the Middle East. I am not 
zeroing on any particular country mind you. But alam naman natin there are 
tribes in the Middle East which would allow rape as part of the territory of 
being a househelp. Kasama ‗yan, kasama talaga ‗yan. So iyan ang mahirap 
diyan. You have a wife there being crucified, being used. Magpadala ng pera 
tapos ang mga anak nasa shabu na rin kasi these are the guys that the 
shabu people would really you know they st ick by them until it crumbles, the 
resistance. And then you have plenty of this all over the country. Hindi lang 
nila alam ‗yung sinasabi nila na misery sa itong human rights, plus 10 ‗yan. 
Not to count the victims of crimes perpetrated by people addicted to shabu. 
That is the reason why I‘m so vicious in my --- galit talaga ako kasi 
nilalaruan tayo. Well, I don‘t know any other president might --- pero ako 
ayaw ko ‗yon. Ayaw kong lalaruan ang Pilipino. Do not do it in my country 
because I will really kill you. That is a commitment.  
  
Owning safe, decent and affordable housing is every Filipino‘s dream. But 
the housing market remains inaccessible to most of our countrymen.I renew my call for Congress to pass the National Housing Development bill 
and the R ental Housing Subsidy bill. These will enable all Filipinos —
regardless of social status —to live in decent homes where their families can 
lead meaningful lives.  
  
I also call on Congress to amend Republic Act No. 10912 [or] the Continuing 
Professional Development Act of 2016. In this time of great pandemic and 
forthcoming reconstruction, requiring our professionals to undergo seminars 
is burdensome and not realistic . This must end.  
  
  
Ito pang isa, there are --- may mga profession… Isingit ko na lang lahat 
tutal this is to inform the nation. May mga profession na they would require 
--- I think it‘s the nurses --- they would require them to come to Manila to 
retrain and --- for another round of expenses. Itong mga seminar -seminar 
na ito dapat mahinto. I don‘t know in other provinces  [applause]  but during 
my time ‗yang --- [ano ‘tong sa barangay na?]  barangay expeditions ng mga 
opisyal, hininto ko rin ‗yan. Which remin ds me, I will act on this also in due 
time.  
  
We hail our health professionals as heroes. Now is the time to pass the 
Advanced Nursing --- iyan ho --- Nursing Education Act and the law 
instituting the Medical Reserve Corps.  
  
COVID -19 will not only be the last pandemic. We need to create a National 
Disease Prevention and Management Authority to better respond to future 
outbreaks. We count on Congress‘ full support. You can just let it remain for 
a while in the Department of Health kung wala pang pera but yo u have to 
expand the services or it will also entail a little bit of money but not really as 
much as expensive when you set up a department.  
  
In the long term, we are looking into the creation of the National Disease 
Prevention and Management Authority to  better prepare for pandemics, 
protect lives, and allow development to proceed even in the worst of times. 
We are counting on the full support of Congress for this critically important 
endeavor.  
  
I don‘t know but I‘ll leave it to Congress to really… It‘s another department. 
There seems that it could be a multilayer redundant thing between the 
health and the proposed department.  
  
I call on Congress to prioritize the passage of a law for the Unified System of 
Separation, Retirement and Pension of the Milita ry and Uniformed Personnel 
without however diminishing the benefits that our uniformed personnel areentitled to under existing laws.  [applause]  There is a need to adjust the 
pension system which will be applicable only to newly -hired uniformed 
personnel s o as not to cause a ―ballooning effect‖ against the budget of the 
military in the years to come and yet maintain the pension benefits of those 
already in service under the present law. This issue needs a solution 
now. Umpisahan natin ngayon para hindi na m aging problema sa susunod na 
mga taon.  
  
I want to… You know one of the… This is not politicking, I am not running. I 
cannot run anymore. Iyong dinoble ko ‗yung suweldo ng pulis pati army it 
was really a clarion call para for them also to have a decent lif e and they are 
able to get the things which ordinarily cannot be reached by any government 
employee. Ang akin doon is ‗yung corruption that maybe it might be a vain 
attempt but maybe dagdagan ang suweldo para it would be a hedge against 
corruption.  
  
We mu st also modernize the Bureau of Fire Protection and the Bureau of 
Immigration with urgency.  
 
Alam mo sa Davao and if you go there I can show you, one of the 
serviceable trucks, fire trucks that we have in the City of Davao… Of course 
ang city mayroon ng sa rili aside from the Bureau of Fire --- Bureau of Fire 
which is really national, mayroon 'yung Bureau of Fire. Would you believe it? 
Serviceable still. Ang pangalan ng truck, Studebaker. Ang katawan --- ang 
talagang matatag ang katawan. Kaya ang makina, Isu zu. [laughter]  Pero 
okay pa rin. It can put out fire. Totoo. This is how this Bureau of Fire issue 
na medyo na --- na-overlook natin nang matagal.   
  
  
I emphasize the creation of the Department of Disaster Resilience. Our 
people‘s safety cannot be delegat ed to a council or commission. Equally 
important is the establishment of evacuation centers in every city, province 
and municipality throughout the country. We must act [now] before another 
major disaster shakes [us] into action.  
  
The problem is disaster and even a fire cannot be --- make --- they cannot 
make a study for projection when the earthquake would suddenly come and 
make a big crack there. Hindi natin alam talaga.  
  
Ang ibig kong sabihin, this will require more than just one brainwork kung 
paano t alaga itong how to prevent or avoid disaster. It will be... By the way, 
just before starting, I was tempted to say it pero baka magtindigan kayo. It 
will be all right for me if Bong Go will just stay. Wala akong problema. Kasi 
sabi ko na this piece of spee ch of mine would be one of the longest SONAsthat I will deliver. Nakita ko 'yung page pagbigay sa akin. Iyong ibang input, 
akin. But 'yung iba lahat. Ang nangyari po, binalik ko sa kanila. ―Make it 
short.‖ Pagbalik sa akin, mas makapal na. ""Naku, p***** i **."" Eh di 
nandiyan na ngayon. Ito na ngayon.  
  
The responsible extraction and equitable distribution of natural resources 
remain among my non -negotiables. I reiterate the need for the passage of 
the National Land Use Act which has been pending for decades.  Pakisilip lang 
ho ninyo 'yan.  
  
For the rest of my term, I hope to see concerted efforts in protecting the 
environment.  
  
The rehabilitation of Boracay Island showcased our resolve to safeguard the 
environment.  [applause]  Boracay is doing well because of its scenery. If it‘s 
only a cocon ut and a black --- white sand and water, wala ‗yan. Pero you 
add the --- the visitors there, then it becomes a very tempting destination.  
  
We have seen the remarkable reemergence of the Island back to its former 
glory. I want this sustained. I ask Congres s to enact a law creating --- 
importante ito --- the Boracay Island [Development] Authority or BIDA. We 
need it.  
  
  
I cannot stress enough the importance of agriculture. The growth of our 
economy depends on a robust agricultural sector.  
  
We must utilize  the coconut  --- ito, isa --- we must utilize  the [coco  levy 
funds]  for the welfare  our coconut  farmers  and the development  of our 
coconut  industry.  I urge everybody  --- both of the Executive  Department  
pati ito --- that ito 'yung  pera na nakuha  doon sa na-sequester.  And itong 
perang  malaking  ito, gagamitin  ito for the welfare  of the farmers.  
 
The problem  is, we can no longer  trace who are the farmers  of yesterday.  
Marcos  was --- Marcos  is a distant  star. We do not know.  Ako, alam ko 
because  we had a little piece also that was covered  by the land reform.  Hindi 
na natin malaman  kung sino ang may-ari. 
 
So I think Congress  should  look again  and try to sort out how best the 
money  can be utilized.  I will not make  any suggestion  but I leave  it to 
Congress  to decide what to do with it.I once again urge both Houses of Congress to pass a version of the bill 
establishing the Coconut Farmers‘ Trust Fund.  Tulungan natin ang ating mga 
magsasaka pagka hindi mawawala ‘yang pera, bilyon ‘yan. [applause] Jusko 
po. Well anyway the… We have learned so many lessons along the way.  
  
I am also requesting Congress to pass the Rural Agricultural and Fisheries 
Development Financing System Act.  
  
We aim to provide adequate, accessible and affordable food for every Filipino 
[family] through the Plant, Plant, Plant Program.  [applause]  After the Build,  
Build,  Build…  I think this is easier  to achieve.  A few good men --- a few good 
regional  directors,  DAR and the dedicated  workers  down  below  could  make  
this thing a success.  Mas madali ito kaysa  Build,  Build,  Build.  Ito Plant,  Plant,  
Plant lang eh. It is more of a the --- well, how you try to convince  the 
farmers  to cooperate  with government  for their benefit.  
  
  
This PhP66 -billion agricultural stimulus package will help the agricul ture and 
fisheries sector recover. I hope so.  [applause]   
  
  
We need to build trust and confidence in online transactions, stronger 
protection for online consumers and enabling measures for online businesses 
is needed through the enactment of an Internet Transactions Act 
(ITA).  [applause]  This is very good.  
  
  
I thus direct the Department of Trade and Industry and other relevant 
[government] agencies to work closely with Congress in ensuring that the 
provisions of the proposed bill are responsive to the needs of the consumers 
while promoting the growth of e -Comm erce in the country.  [applause]  If you 
are tired of clapping,  you just say so. I can make  a 
shortcut.  [laughter]  Pabilisan  lang 'yan.  
  
  
On the path to better governance, we travel with others. Partners – both old 
and new - have helped. For bolstering ou r antiquated public health system, 
for bringing home our laid off Filipinos overseas, for filling in supply gaps for 
crucial medical supplies and equipment and staple food, for these and many 
more, the Philippines thanks all friendly nations. We will never  forget your 
kindness and your timely support.Within ASEAN and beyond, the Philippines will continue to work with 
partners to address global perils and ramp up cooperation to secure for our 
peoples, greater peace, progress and prosperity.  
  
The Filipino  nation claims its rightful place in the community of sovereign 
states. Thus, we will continue to pursue an independent foreign policy. Let 
me be very clear about this.  
  
May I cut my prepared  speech?  Alam mo, I read a little over three  weeks  or 
last month  na the Americans  would  --- intends  to go back to Subic.  
  
I will just put on record  my thoughts.  I have nothing  against  America,  I have 
nothing  against  China  but if you put bases  here, you will double  the 
spectacle  of a most destructive  thing just like Manila during  the Second  
World  War --- during  the retaking  of this city. One of the most devastated  
cities in the world.  
  
  
Kaya maglagay -lagay  ka ng base at this time, this will ensure  if war breaks  
out, because  there  would  be atomic  arsenals  brought  in, this will ensure  the 
extinction  of the Filipino  race.  
  
We worked without fail to protect our rights in the South China Sea, neither 
beholden nor a pawn to anyone. We broadened the boundaries of Philippine 
diplomacy. We built productive ties with everyone w illing to engage us on 
the basis of equality and mutual respect. And, we redefined our relationships 
with our most important partners, placing the country in a far better position 
to advance our interests in an evolving regional order and emerging global 
problems.  [applause]  
  
  
Now, plenty  of critics,  both sides,  claim about  nothing  has been done to 
retake  forcefully  or physically  the South  China  Sea.  
  
Alam mo, unless  we are prepared  to go to war, I would  suggest  that we 
better  just call off and treat this, I said, with diplomatic  endeavors.  
  
China  is claiming  it. We are claiming  it. China  has the arms,  we do not have 
it. 
  
So, it is simple  as that. They are in possession  of the property.  It will remain  
a property  of a --- if you're  a lawyer,  property  rights.They are --- it has nothing  to do with the Philippine  Laws of Property  but it‘s 
akin to --- they are in possession.  So what can we do? We have to go to war 
and I cannot  afford  it. Maybe  some  other  president  can, but I cannot.  Inutil 
ako diyan,  sabihin  ko sa inyo. And I'm willing  to admit  it. Talagang  inutil ako 
diyan.  Wala akong  magawa.  I cannot...  
  
The moment  I send my Marines  there  at the coastal  shores  of Palawan,  
tinamaan  ng cruise  missile  lahat iyan. Hindi pa nga naka-set sail iyan eh, 
sabog  na. 
  
Let me say again that victory in the global battle against COVID -19 would 
take longer than we expect . Everyone‘s cooperation is needed. I know that 
you, the Filipino people, have sacrificed a lot. But we have no other choice 
but to work together and to do even more.  
  
I must admit that our actions have been far from perfect --- totoo iyan I 
admit it --- and there could be improvements here or there —but all of us in 
government, including myself, assure you that we will not stop until we get 
things right and better for you.  [applause]  
  
I know that many of you are worried not only about health and safety bu t 
also about our ability to move around and ride public transportation; the 
depletion of your savings due to the rising cost of goods; and the loss of 
your incomes due to uncertainties in your jobs and livelihood. I assure you 
that your government will [sq uarely address] these problems and challenges 
to overcome them and proceed to the ‗new normal‘.  
  
Marami ho talagang mawawalaan ng --- those for the middle -income. They 
buy a car on installment basis. If you cannot keep up with the amortization, 
you'll los e it --- you‘ll lose the car and you are forced to ride on public 
utilities.  
  
  
Concomitantly, didiretso rin itong mga criminal na rarami at crimes will 
increase. But let me assure you, for as long as I am President, there can 
never be a runaway crime in any of our cities. Hindi ako papayag ng 
ganun.  I can assure  you we will remain  peaceful  --- relatively  
peaceful.  [applause]  Hindi naman  very peaceful.  Pero kung sabihin  mo na 
kagaya  ng holdup  dito, holdup,  ah... Alam naman  nila kung ano mangyayari.  
You know what will happen  to you.  
  
I am addressing  myself  to the criminals.  You commit  holdups,  you commit  
rapes,  you commit  all sorts of things  and you harm the public,  then kaaway  
mo na ako. Kapag  bumalik  kayo sa dati kagaya  noon,  patong -patong  nanaman  ang patay dito. Sigurado  hahanapin  ko kayo.  Do not ever go back to 
your old ways.  Maghanap  na lang kayo ng anong  trabaho  diyan.  Magtiis  
kayo.  
  
  
To open up the economy to pre -Covid -19 levels at this time is not an option 
because whatever good it can produce wil l only be gobbled up, or be 
outweighed, by the bad it will generate. Sometimes, haste does make waste. 
The recent upsurge of infections when we opened little windows to the 
resumption of business is proof of that.  
  
I am happy that I have talked to you tod ay. You know, in other places they 
opened up too early too soon. America is one. China --- well fortunately, it 
was arrested on time. China and the rest for those who opened up and those 
who do not follow the protocols of the --- at least the World Health 
Organization --- they are suffering and they have at least 140 deaths.  
  
Ang Amerika nagkukulang sila lahat. No nation on earth was really prepared 
for COVID. No amount of preparation because that kind of microbes visits 
about once every 100 years. Wala ma n ‗yung --- mga tatay natin, what they 
suffered was Second World War, but tayo…  
  
We are not ready and therefore we will not gamble with the lives and health 
of the people. Certainly, no one would want to end up on the negative side 
of the equation. Not me , not us.  
  
All I ask is that you continue to put your faith in your government and work 
with us in achieving what is best for our country and our people. Together, 
let us do --- mahirap basahin kasi dito eh --- the most that we can to ensure 
that the heal th, safety and well -being of every Filipino —especially those 
severely affected —are taken care of.  
  
Together, we shall fight this pandemic with the same fervor as our campaign 
against illegal drugs, criminality, insurgency, and corruption in high places 
and entrenched parochial interests.  
  
As a government worker, I am addressing each and every Filipino that the 
government cannot do this without your help. More than ever, we need toreinvigorate the deep -seated Filipino spirit of  pakisama  and malasakit  within 
each and everyone of us.  
  
We are being --- we are being tested, as a people and as a nation. Wor se 
times loom ahead. But I do hope that this spirit of solidarity and unity will 
serve as the drumbeat to which we shall march in unison in our quest for the 
light at the end of the tunnel.  
  
I appeal to each and every Filipino, let us take care of one ano ther. Ito ang 
panahon para magtulungan. Hindi ito ang panahon para  maglamanan --- 
maglaman --- lamang -lamangan --- lamang. Mamang p*** --- dila 
ko. [applause]  Hindi maglamang --- at pagkakaisa.  
  
My faith in the Filipino innate patience, resilience and de termination to 
bounce back is unwavering. Let us share our blessings with those who have 
little and those who have none. This is the time to bring out the best in us.  
  
The woes that weigh heavily upon our shoulders may bend our back, but 
they shall not be nd or break our spirit.  
  
From the rubbles of adversity, a more resilient and stronger nation built 
on Bayanihan  and Pagkakaisa  shall rise.  
  
Together, we shall overcome.  
  
Before I… Pardon the time but it was really the allotted time for my speech. I 
would just like to give a statement between --- between us sa gobyerno 
kung hindi tayo nagkakaintindihan.  
  
You know Drilon, stand it --- he was defending… I would like to ask Drilon, 
were you a part of ACCRA when this contract of Ayala water was being 
drafted ?And why are you fumigating? Bakit kasi ikaw lang ang galit? Na sabi mo na 
dynasty -dynasty. You are a hypocrite. You know that you cannot pass an 
anti-dynasty law. Ikaw ang nandiyan sa Congress, ‗di ikaw ang mauna dito.  
  
But you know, to take it agains t me for protecting my country is something 
which I really resent. Alam mo you described using the dictionary the 
synonym ng mga oligarchs, oligarchy, kung ano, then you proceeded to 
characterize everyone every --- every name and then said that oligarchy i s 
not bad at all because sa --- not all oligarchies are bad. True.  
  
But ito, to my countrymen, the oligarchy that exists in this country is the 
oligarchy that existed during the Spanish time. And the Spanish lands and 
the friar lands and all the benefits that were passed on to the Insulares who 
did not go back to Spain or to the Spaniards and into their… But that was 
long ago, it has been forgotten. This is the oligarchy that controls the 
Philippines by what? By taking control of the water and the electric ity and 
power. Iyan ang oligarchy mo Drilon . [applause]  
  
Wala ng oligarchy dito except that. They have controlled. Look at… How can 
you now craft a new contract? Because I would insist that you pay the 
billions and billions that you collected.  
  
For example, water treatment. O nandiyan sa kontrata. It‘s in the billing, 
they are being collected since 1997. Ilang bilyon na nga wala ni isa, not 
even a faucet was built for a water treatment facility.  
  
Iyan ang mahirap sa… You do not protect the oligarchs here. You are the 
one. Ikaw lang mag -isa. And I suspect that you were also the one --- or 
helped when you were there in the ACCRA.  
  
We do not even know the --- ang mga abogado sa public documents hindi  
nga alam. Hindi nga natin alam kung naka -graduate ba o hindi. Wala. Would 
you think Ayala would get the services of those…? Ayala got ACCRA. ACCRA 
did it. Ikaw galing ka doon, most of you, more successful lawyers sa 
corporation, you handle big corporate. Iyan ang mahirap.Bangga tayo dito. Me, hinawakan ninyo eh. Hindi ka puwede kay… Kita mo 
noong nag -increase, walang tubig, pinuputol ‗yung tubig, ang tao bumigay 
kasi hindi puwede man tayo hindi maligo, hindi uminom. Electricity ayaw mo 
mag-increase. O a yan, wala ka, palaging brownout, lahat.  
  
I‘m sorry but I have to say this to you. I do not like it. It‘s not the time for 
it, but since it is the time for the SONA, for people to know and people to 
really get the facts, then --- and the right of the peopl e to be heard.  
  
Tayo na naman ang tao magsabi. Hinawakan ninyo ‗yang tubig pati 
electricity, iyon ang oligarchy talaga. Kaya ako sinabi ko noong kampanya 
―corruption is not here.‖ Iyang mga Customs na ‗yan, maliit ‗yan. It‘s there 
upstairs. And I was real ly --- and providential, dumating ‗yung panahon na 
hindi ko hiningi. Then I saw the contract. Noong nakita ko ‗yung contract…  
  
At saka ‗yang linya na ano, ‗yung choice --- trans --- ‗yung linya  ng ano, it 
belongs to government. The best of the transmissio n lines, whatever, 
government gets it first before anybody else.  
  
Thank you. I am through . [applause]
