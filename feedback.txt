**QUESTION:** bagyo

**RESPONSE:** The word "bagyo" translates to "storm" or "typhoon" in English and appears in the context of the following excerpt from the given State of the Nation Address documents:

"We have seen the terrible toll that Super typhoon Yolanda and the succeeding typhoons exacted in terms of human life and property. And we still have to recover from the beating that we got both during and in the aftermath of those mega-typhoons."

This excerpt indicates the mention of typhoons, using "Super typhoon Yolanda" as an example. Therefore, in these documents, "bagyo" would be relevant in discussing natural disasters such as typhoons.
